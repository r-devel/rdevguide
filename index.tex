\chapter{R Patched and Development Versions}\label{GetStart}

These instructions cover how to install R from source or from binaries.
Contributors will typically need to work with the patched or development
versions of R. This chapter describes where the source code for these
versions can be found and how to install these versions from the source
or the binary builds (where available). The tools required to build R
and R packages are also discussed. For the most up to date and complete
instructions you can check the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html}{R
installation and administration manual} .

\section{The R source code}\label{the-r-source-code}

R uses \href{https://subversion.apache.org/}{svn} as a version control
tool hosted at \url{https://svn.r-project.org/R/} and uses a
`major.minor.patchlevel' version numbering scheme\footnote{Also known as
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning\#Semantic_versioning}{semantic
  versioning}}.

There are three releases of R available to install:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The latest official release (\texttt{r-release}), either major version
  x.0.0 or minor version x.y.0, for example: 3.0.0 or 3.2.0
\item
  The patched release (\texttt{r-patched}), for example 3.0.1 or 3.2.1
  and
\item
  The development release (\texttt{r-devel}) : continually developed
  version moving from r-release to next major/minor version (x + 1).0.0
  or x.(y + 1).0 a few weeks before release (at the start of the ``GRAND
  FEATURE FREEZE'').
\end{itemize}

The source code of released versions of R can be found at
\href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/tags/}{R/tags}, the patched versions
are at \href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/}{R/branch}.

The \texttt{r-devel} at
\href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk}{R/trunk} is the next minor or
eventual major release development version of R. Bug fixes and new
features are introduced in \texttt{r-devel} first. If the change meets
the
\href{https://developer.r-project.org/devel-guidelines.txt}{development
guidelines} R Core will also make the change in \texttt{r-patched}.

\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}

To install from the source code you will need the source code and the
dependencies of R.

If you need to install svn you can use your distribution's package
manager to install it.

\subsection{Ubuntu}\label{ubuntu}

In Ubuntu you can use this command to find all the dependencies of R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{apt{-}rdepends} \AttributeTok{{-}{-}build{-}depends} \AttributeTok{{-}{-}follow}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{DEPENDS r{-}base{-}dev }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{grep} \StringTok{" B"} \KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{sed} \AttributeTok{{-}e} \StringTok{"s/  Build{-}Depends: //"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It might require installation of apt-rdepends which can be done from
default repositories via \texttt{sudo\ apt-get\ install\ apt-rdepends}.

To install all the R dependencies you can use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sudo}\NormalTok{ apt{-}get build{-}dep r{-}base{-}dev}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Fedora}\label{fedora}

In Fedora you can use this command to find all the dependencies of R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{dnf}\NormalTok{ rq }\AttributeTok{{-}q} \AttributeTok{{-}{-}repo}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{fedora{-}source }\AttributeTok{{-}{-}requires}\NormalTok{ R }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You will also need the rsync package to download the recommended
packages.

To install them you can use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{dnf}\NormalTok{ install }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}dnf{-}command(builddep)\textquotesingle{}}
\ExtensionTok{dnf}\NormalTok{ install rsync}
\ExtensionTok{dnf}\NormalTok{ builddep R}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Building R}\label{building-r}

It is recommended to build R in a different path than the source. For
this reason we have a \texttt{TOP\_SRCDIR} variable where the source
code goes and the variable \texttt{BUILDDIR} where the built R version
will go.

\subsection{Linux}\label{linux}

Here are the basic steps intended as a checklist. For complete
instructions please see the section in
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html\#Installing-R-under-Unix_002dalikes}{R-admin}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item
  Retrieve R source code via into \texttt{TOP\_SRCDIR}, note that we
  retrieve the \texttt{r-devel} source code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{TOP\_SRCDIR}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$HOME}\StringTok{/Downloads/R"}
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ checkout https://svn.r{-}project.org/R/trunk/ }\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Download the latest recommended packages\footnote{Recommended packages
    are not in the subversion repository.}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{/tools/rsync{-}recommended"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Create the build directory in the \texttt{BUILDDIR}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{BUILDDIR}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$HOME}\StringTok{/bin/R"}
\FunctionTok{mkdir} \AttributeTok{{-}p} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$BUILDDIR}\StringTok{"}
\BuiltInTok{cd} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$BUILDDIR}\StringTok{"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Configure the R installation (with \texttt{-\/-enable-R-shlib} so that
  RStudio IDE can use it):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{/configure"} \AttributeTok{{-}{-}enable{-}R{-}shlib}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Build R :

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{make}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Check that R works as expected:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  There are other checks you can run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check{-}devel}
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check{-}recommended}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\end{enumerate}

If we don't want to build R in a different directory than the source
code we can simply use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ update}
\ExtensionTok{tools/rsync{-}recommended}
\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{/configure"}  \AttributeTok{{-}{-}enable{-}R{-}shlib}
\FunctionTok{make} 
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once you successfully built R from source you can modify the R source
code to fix an issue: Prepare a patch (See
\href{https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html\#how-to-submit-patches}{this
guide}) and after checking that R works as intended
(\texttt{make\ check-devel}) submit the patch for consideration by R
Core. (See the \hyperref[FixBug]{lifecycle of a patch} chapter).

To use the \texttt{r-devel} version in RStudio, you can do the
following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{RSTUDIO\_WHICH\_R}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$BUILDDIR}\StringTok{/bin/R"}
\BuiltInTok{cd} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\ExtensionTok{rstudio}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Windows}\label{windows}

\subsubsection{Binaries}\label{binaries}

The binary builds of R for Windows can be downloaded and installed from
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/}{here}. Along with
the link to the latest stable release, this page also contains links to
the binary builds of \texttt{r-patched} and \texttt{r-devel}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click on the download links to download an executable installer.
\item
  Select the language while installing, read the GNU general public
  license information, and select the destination location to start the
  installation. You will be prompted to select components at this stage:
  \texttt{User\ installation}, \texttt{64-bit\ User\ installation}, or
  \texttt{Custom\ installation}. The default option may be chosen for
  the questions from this step onwards to complete the installation.
\end{enumerate}

Daily binaries for \texttt{r-devel} are made available for
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html}{download
and installation}.

\subsubsection{From source}\label{windowsSource}

Before installing R from source, some additional programs are needed, as
per the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html}{latest
documentation}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}{Rtools} is the
  suggested toolchain bundle for building R base and R packages
  containing compiled code on Windows. The latest
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html}{version
  of Rtools} can be installed using the
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/}{Rtools
  installer rtools44-XXXX-XXX.exe}.
\item
  A LaTeX compiler is needed to install and build R, check packages and
  build manuals. On CRAN, MiKTeX is used, which can be downloaded from
  \url{https://miktex.org}. Once installed open MiKTeX via the Windows
  start menu. It might ask to check for updates and more importantly, to
  make it available in PATH. You can accept both.
\item
  Open the Rtools44 terminal to update and install subversion:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{pacman} \AttributeTok{{-}Syuu}
\ExtensionTok{pacman} \AttributeTok{{-}Sy}\NormalTok{ wget subversion}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Retrieve the latest source code via subversion:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{TOP\_SRCDIR}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$HOME}\StringTok{/Downloads/R"}
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ checkout https://svn.r{-}project.org/R/trunk/ }\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  If you already have the repository available you can update as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd} \VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ update}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  You can also use a SVN client such as TortoiseSVN
  (\url{https://tortoisesvn.net/}, command line tool, and Windows
  Explorer integration) or SlikSVN (\url{https://sliksvn.com/download/},
  just the command line tool) so that it can be also found by other
  tools.
\item
  Download the latest tcl/tk and unzip it in \texttt{\$TOP\_SRCDIR}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\FunctionTok{wget} \AttributeTok{{-}np} \AttributeTok{{-}nd} \AttributeTok{{-}r} \AttributeTok{{-}l1} \AttributeTok{{-}A} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{}tcltk{-}*.zip\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{ https://cran.r{-}project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/}
\FunctionTok{unzip} \StringTok{"tcltk{-}*.zip"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Add gcc, MiKTeX and tar to the PATH and set one tar option:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{PATH}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"/x86\_64{-}w64{-}mingw32.static.posix/bin:}\VariableTok{$PATH}\StringTok{"}
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{PATH}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"/c/Program Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:}\VariableTok{$PATH}\StringTok{"}
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{TAR}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"/usr/bin/tar"}
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{TAR\_OPTIONS}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"{-}{-}force{-}local"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  If MiKTeX was installed just for your user you might need to run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{PATH}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"/c/Users/}\VariableTok{$USER}\StringTok{/AppData/Local/Programs/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:}\VariableTok{$PATH}\StringTok{"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Check that all the programs can be found:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{which}\NormalTok{ make gcc pdflatex tar}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  If there is any error you'll need to find where the program is
  installed and add the corresponding path.
\item
  Download the latest recommended packages\footnote{Recommended packages
    are not in the subversion repository.}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{/src/gnuwin32/"}
\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{/tools/rsync{-}recommended"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\item
  Build R and the recommended packages:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ all recommended}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  The recently compiled version of R will be at
  \texttt{\$TOP\_SRCDIR/bin/}. In RStudio you can select that folder and
  restart it to use the \texttt{r-devel} version.
\item
  Check that R works as expected:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  There are other checks you can run for testing the successful
  installation of the recommended packages:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check{-}devel}
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check{-}recommended}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Issue Tracking}\label{IssueTrack}

Base R uses \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/}{Bugzilla} for issue
tracking and reporting bugs.

\section{How to contribute to issue
tracking?}\label{how-to-contribute-to-issue-tracking}

Contributors can support issue tracking in R by

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \hyperref[ReportingBugs]{Reporting bugs} or
  \hyperref[FeatureRequests]{submitting feature requests} (bug reports
  filed under the ``Wishlist'' component in Bugzilla),
\item
  \href{https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/ReviewBugs.html}{Reviewing
  bug reports} to help close reports where no fix is needed or to help
  narrow down the problem and identify what needs to be fixed, or
\item
  \href{https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html\#FixBug}{Proposing
  changes} to code or documentation that will close an issue.
\end{enumerate}

\section{How to get a Bugzilla account?}\label{bugzilla-account}

Anyone can browse the bug reports on Bugzilla, but you will need an
account to file a bug report, to comment on an existing bug report, or
to submit a proposed fix in the form of patch file.

To get a Bugzilla account send an e-mail to
\texttt{bug-report-request@r-project.org} from the address you want to
use as your Bugzilla login. Briefly explain why you want a Bugzilla
account and a volunteer will add you to R's Bugzilla members. After
having successfully logged in to Bugzilla, you are good to go.

\subsection{Navigating Bugzilla}\label{Bugzilla}

An image of the existing home page of Bugzilla is shared below:

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/bugzilla.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the existing home page of Bugzilla.}

\end{figure}%

On the home page of Bugzilla, there are various buttons and links. There
are four square buttons called as:

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/squarebuttons.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the four square buttons on the home page of
Bugzilla.}

\end{figure}%

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/enter_bug.cgi}{File a bug}: You will
  have to log in to Bugzilla to file a bug using this button
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/query.cgi}{Search}: When you click
  this button you will get a page with `Simple Search' and `Advanced
  Search' options. Either of the search options could be used depending
  on what you are looking for.
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/?GoAheadAndLogIn=1}{Log In}: Provide
  the appropriate email address and password here to log in to Bugzilla.
\item
  \href{https://bugzilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/index.html}{Documentation}:
  Provides a user guide for R\textquotesingle s Bugzilla.
\end{enumerate}

Several useful shortcuts are available from the landing page:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/enter_bug.cgi}{Enter a new bug
  report}
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bugidtype=include&chfieldto=Now&cmdtype=doit&emailassigned_to1=1&emailassigned_to2=1&emailcc2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailtype1=substring&emailtype2=substring&field0-0-0=noop&long_desc_type=substring&order=bugs.delta_ts\%20desc&query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&type0-0-0=noop}{Show

\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/query.cgi}{Search existing bug
  reports}
\end{enumerate}

A \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html}{quick
search} bar is available on the home page where you can enter a bug
number to search or some search terms.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/quicksearch.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the quick search bar on the home page of
Bugzilla.}

\end{figure}%

There is also a section for Common Queries on the home page which
includes links to bugs reported and changed in the last 24 hours and
last 7 days.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/commonquery.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the Common Queries section on the home page of
Bugzilla.}

\end{figure}%

\section{Searching for Bugs to Contribute to}\label{searching}

When presented with a long list of bugs, it can often be a bit
demotivating when it's not clear where to start. To help with this, you
can use the
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/query.cgi?format=advanced}{\textbf{Advanced
Search}}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/bugzilla-adv-search-home.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of Advanced Search page showing the following
fields: Summary, Product, Component, Status, Resolution}

\end{figure}%

This presents several fields that you can use to narrow down your
search. You can find out what a particular field is by clicking on the
header, which will take you to that section in the
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html}{\textbf{Bug
Fields Information Page}}.

The default fields are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html\#short_desc}{Summary}:
  a short description of the bug
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html\#product}{Product}:
  either R or RTools.
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html\#component}{Component}:
  A specific component of the R toolchain such as Graphics,
  Documentation, and Models
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html\#bug_status}{Status}:
  The status of open or closed bugs. This will always default to showing
  open bugs (UNCONFIRMED, CONFIRMED, and IN\_PROGRESS)
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html\#resolution}{Resolution}:
  The resolution for closed bugs.
\end{itemize}

You can select multiple items for each field as well. Both
\textbf{Product} and \textbf{Component} are what you navigate through
when you go to
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/describecomponents.cgi}{\textbf{Browse
Issues}}.

Below that are further filters that can help you find bugs you might
want to work on:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Detailed Bug Information: Narrow results by the following fields]
Comments, URL, Keywords, Deadline, Bug Numbers, Version, Severity,
Priority, Hardware, OS Search By People

Narrow results to a role (i.e.~Assignee, Reporter, Commenter, etc.) a
person has on a bug Search By Change History

Narrow results to how fields have changed during a specific time period
Custom Search

Didn't find what you're looking for above? This area allows for ANDs,
ORs, and other more complex searches.
\end{description}

These will be detailed in the subsections below

\subsection{Detailed Bug Information}\label{searching-dbi}

You can use this section to narrow down your search further to filter by
things like OS type, R version, Keywords, and Priority.

It can be helpful, for example, to search for bugs labelled with
\texttt{HELPWANTED}, which indicates bugs that may be suitable for
anyone to work on regardless of expertise.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/bugzilla-adv-search-detailed-bug-info.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of expanded Detailed Bug Information section showing
the following fields: Comment, URL, Keywords (with HELPWANTED entered),
Deadline, inclusion/exclusion of bug numbers, Version, Severity,
Priority, Hardware, and OS}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Search By People}\label{searching-sbp}

You can use this to narrow down your search to only include results of a
specific person or up to three people who have participated in any
component of the bug's discusson.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/bugzilla-adv-search-search-by-people.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of expanded Search By People section showing three
fields allowing you to enter a person's name who can be any of the bug
assignee, the reporter, a CC list member, or a commenter}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Search By Change History}\label{searching-sbch}

Use this to search for bugs where any of the status fields has been
changed (which, depending on the change, could indicate that someone
from R-Core has given some attention to the bug). This also provides a
date range to narrow your search.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/bugzilla-adv-search-search-by-change-history.png}}

\chapter{Reporting Bugs}\label{ReportingBugs}

\section{What is a bug in R?}\label{what-is-a-bug-in-r}

You may find a bug in R if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The R session terminates unexpectedly, or there is a segmentation
  fault, it might be a bug in R, unless you have written your own call
  to compiled code or an internal function (via \texttt{.C} or
  \texttt{.Internal}). The error may look like this:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\#  *** caught segfault ***}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# address (nil), cause \textquotesingle{}memory not mapped\textquotesingle{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  If the code does not do what the documentation says it should, then
  either the code or the documentation is wrong. Report either of which
  needs to be fixed.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note}: When you are in doubt that there is a bug: (which should
be the case most of the time!)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure whether the bug appears in a clean session of R. Many times,
  there are variables/commands/functions stored in the workspace which
  might cause issues. Hence, check if the issue happens in a clean
  session. To do so, launch R from the command line with the
  \texttt{-\/-vanilla} option.
\item
  At times the code that is written is very complicated, has numerous
  package and file dependencies, has many function calls, etc.. In such
  scenarios it is quite common that the code throws an error and you are
  not able to solve it. You may tend to think that there is a bug that
  needs to be reported. Before doing so, try to produce a minimum
  working example of the code for the section where the error occurred.
  Add only those packages and files which are required by that section,
  and see if the error still appears. Using this approach shall solve
  most of the errors.
\item
  Install R-devel, which is the most recent version of R from
  \href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/}{svn} /
  \href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn}{git} or
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html}{daily
  Windows build}, and see if your bug still exists in R-devel (it may
  have been fixed very recently).
\item
  \href{https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/template/NamlServlet.jtp?macro=search_page&node=909078&query=isna&days=0}{Search
  on the R-devel mailing list for messages with keywords related to your
  possible bug}. If you find some related messages then read them to see
  if they clarify whether or not it is a bug. If you do not find any
  related messages, then please post a new message to R-devel. Your
  message should include (1) a brief description of the bug including
  current and expected behavior, (2) a minimal reproducible example.
\end{enumerate}

\section{What condition might not be a
bug?}\label{what-condition-might-not-be-a-bug}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In case the code is doing something unexpected, it may not necessarily
  be a bug. Carefully review the documentation of the function being
  called, and check whether the behaviour being exhibited on calling
  this function is the same as it was designed to do.
\item
  Issues with
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html\#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f}{\emph{seemingly}
  identical numbers} not being equal (especially floating point numbers)
  are usually not bugs.
\item
  If R is running slower than expected, then this also may not be a bug.
  Ask someone else to review your code in such a case.
\item
  If some function is working, but it is not defined in the best
  generalised way, then consult someone to look over the code. This may
  perhaps not be a bug; instead, it might be an alternative way of
  writing the function.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Checking if a bug is already
reported}\label{already-reported-bugs}

The first step before filing a bug report is to see whether the problem
has already been reported. Checking if the bug is reported will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Save time for you and the developers.
\item
  Help you see if the bug is already fixed for the next release.
\item
  Lead you to learn what needs to be done to fix it.
\item
  Determine if any additional information is needed.
\end{enumerate}

The sections that follow discuss where to check whether a bug is already
reported.

\section{What are some places where you may find a
bug?}\label{what-are-some-places-where-you-may-find-a-bug}

You may find a bug in:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In the \hyperref[RCorePkgBug]{R-Core supported packages, their
  documentations, and/ or in the R language implementation}.
\item
  In \hyperref[nonRCorePkgBug]{packages and/or their documentations
  which are not supported by the R-Core}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{How to report a bug?}\label{ReportBug}

Once you confirm a bug exists, you need to submit a bug report so that
it gets fixed.

\subsection{Bug in the R-Core supported packages, their documentations,
and/ or in the R language}\label{RCorePkgBug}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Packages that are supported by the R-Core are labelled with
  \texttt{Maintainer:\ R\ Core\ Team\ \textless{}R-core@r-project.org\textgreater{}}.
  One simple way to get the information from R is by running the
  \texttt{maintainer("package\_name")} command.
\item
  The bug report for R-Core supported packages, their documentations,
  and/ or a bug report for the R language itself can be submitted either
  to R-devel,
  \href{https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html\#which_list}{see
  posting guide}, or to
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/}{Bugzilla}. In the future,
  we hope to have an option to report an issue to the
  \href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/issues}{GitHub Mirror of the R
  svn server}.
\item
  In order to report bugs, as well as fixes, using
  \hyperref[Bugzilla]{Bugzilla}, please ensure that you have a
  \hyperref[bugzilla-account]{Bugzilla account}
\item
  Please ensure whether the bug is already fixed (in the upcoming
  changes in R) or reported (search for it from those already reported
  on Bugzilla, either on
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/query.cgi}{search existing
  bug reports}, using the
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/query.cgi?format=advanced}{advanced
  search} option here, or
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bugidtype=include&chfieldto=Now&cmdtype=doit&emailassigned_to1=1&emailassigned_to2=1&emailcc2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailtype1=substring&emailtype2=substring&field0-0-0=noop&long_desc_type=substring&order=bugs.delta_ts\%20desc&query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&type0-0-0=noop}{show
  open bugs new-to-old}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bug in the non R-Core supported packages and/or their
documentations}\label{nonRCorePkgBug}

For packages that are not maintained by the R-Core, the bug reports can
be submitted at, perhaps, an issues tracker url on
GitHub/GitLab/R-Forge. To find if such an issues tracker is available,
you can look at the package \texttt{DESCRIPTION} file first (e.g.~using
\texttt{packageDescription("package\_name")}) to check if a url is
provided in the \texttt{BugReports} field. If that is not available,
then the package maintainer can be contacted (using
\texttt{maintainer("package\_name")}). In R running the function
\texttt{bug.report(package\ =\ "package\_name")} shall direct you to
either the GitHub issue tracker of the package, or to the bug tracking
web page, or towards composing an e-mail to the package maintainer. This
function \texttt{bug.report} is disabled in RStudio, by default.
However, if you use
\texttt{utils::bug.report(package\ =\ "package\_name")} then it works on
RStudio as well. Please ensure that the bug is not already reported or
fixed before reporting it in any of the ways suggested above.

\subsection{Bug in a documentation website managed by the R Core
Team}\label{docWebsRCoreBug}

The R Core Team maintain a selection of websites that each have their
own ways for reporting issues outside of Bugzilla. Have a read through
the \href{https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html}{posting guide
for R project mailing lists} and then follow the instructions below to
give feedback to the maintainers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html}{R FAQ} contains
  answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about R.
  Feedback on the R FAQ should be sent to the
  \href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel}{R-devel mailing
  list} via
  \href{mailto:R-devel@R-project.org}{\nolinkurl{R-devel@R-project.org}}.
\item
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html}{R for
  Windows FAQ} contains answers specific to the Windows port of R.
  Feedback on the Windows FAQ should be sent to the
  \href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-windows}{R-SIG-windows
  mailing list} (the Special Interest Group for Windows), via
  \href{mailto:R-windows@R-project.org}{\nolinkurl{R-windows@R-project.org}}.
\item
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html}{R for
  macOS FAQ} contains a user guide to the R.APP version of R and
  information on using R on macOS, supplementing the main R manuals.
  Feedback on the macOS FAQ should be sent to the
  \href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac}{R-SIG-Mac
  mailing list} (the Special Interest Group for Mac ports of R), via
  \href{mailto:r-sig-mac@r-project.org}{\nolinkurl{r-sig-mac@r-project.org}}.
\item
  Feedback on the \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{R Project website}

\end{itemize}

\section{Good practices in reporting bugs / Expectations of a good bug
report}\label{good-practices-bugs}

If you follow the practices given below, you will come up with a good
bug report which might make it easier for the maintainer(s) to fix the
bug.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Include a minimal reproducible example of the bug in your report. The
  maintainer should be able to quickly reproduce the bug using the
  minimal example that you provide. Here is a
  \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example}{community
  wiki post} on how to make a minimal reproducible example.
\item
  Mention the software architecture on which the bug occurred.
\item
  Use inbuilt data sets as far as possible.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to the above, here are the
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html}{bug
writing guidelines} on Bugzilla. The
\href{https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html\#writing-a-good-bug-report}{bug
reporting} documentation in R also discusses practices to write a good
bug report.

Once you have successfully reported a bug, you will likely receive an
update each time an action is taken on the bug. On Bugzilla, the report
may be given one of the following status: New, Assigned, Confirmed,
Reopened, Unconfirmed.

\section{Disagreement with a resolution on the bug
tracker}\label{disagreement-with-a-resolution-on-the-bug-tracker}

As humans, there might be differences of opinions from time to time.
What needs to be considered here is to be respectful of the fact that
care, thought, and volunteer time has gone into the resolution of the
issue or bug.

If you take some time, then on reflection, the resolution steps may seem
more reasonable than you initially thought. If you still feel that the
resolution is incorrect, then raise a thoughtful question to the person
who resolved it. If the issue was not carefully thought about in the
first place then it is less likely to win any conversion of thought.

As a reminder, issues closed by a core developer on Bugzilla have
already been carefully considered. Please do not reopen a closed issue.
Although one can comment on a closed issue, if necessary. Every comment
on an issue generates an email to every R-core member (unless they have
the notifications disabled). So it would be best to be considerate while
commenting on issues, especially in case of closed issues or when you
are commenting in pure agreement without adding anything beyond that to
a discussion (the +1 type posts which are perfectly acceptable in other
contexts).

\chapter{Submitting Feature Requests}\label{FeatureRequests}

\section{What is a feature request?}\label{what-is-a-feature-request}

A feature request is a suggestion or proposal to add new functionality
or improve an existing feature.

We recommend sharing your feature request idea on the
\href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel}{R-devel} mailing
list and gaining support from R-Core members and other users to increase
its likelihood of acceptance.

\section{How to submit a feature
request?}\label{how-to-submit-a-feature-request}

You can submit a feature request by
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/enter_bug.cgi}{filing a bug} on
Bugzilla. Under Component, select ``Wishlist'', the designated label for
feature requests.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/feature-requests.png}}

}

\caption{The ``Wishlist'' component in Bugzilla's bug submission
screen.}

\end{figure}%

Similar to bugs, you should ensure that the feature request is
\hyperref[already-reported-bugs]{not already reported} and
\hyperref[good-practices-bugs]{follow best practices} whenever possible.

\section{Examples of feature requests submitted on
Bugzilla}\label{examples-of-feature-requests-submitted-on-bugzilla}

\chapter{Reviewing Bugs}\label{ReviewBugs}

\section{How you can help to review bug
reports?}\label{how-you-can-help-to-review-bug-reports}

After understanding where bugs are reported in R (Bugzilla) or in other
projects (GitHub/GitLab/R-Forge), a great way to contribute is reviewing
bug reports.

Around the clock, new bug reports are being submitted on Bugzilla or the
bug trackers (for instance, GitHub issues) of R packages and existing
bug reports are being updated. Every bug report needs to be reviewed to
make sure various things are in proper order. You can help with this
process of reviewing bugs.

\subsection{Preparing to review bug
reports}\label{preparing-to-review-bug-reports}

If you want to review bug reports on Bugzilla, you are required to have
a \hyperref[bugzilla-account]{Bugzilla account}. More details on how you
can review a bug report are available on this post on the R Blog:
\href{https://blog.r-project.org/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports/index.html}{R
Can Use Your Help: Reviewing Bug Reports}

\section{Classifying bug reports}\label{classifying-bug-reports}

A good bug report is the one which:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explains clearly how to reproduce the bug.
\item
  Includes the version of R, the machine architecture, and the operating
  system platform on which the bug occurred.
\end{enumerate}

Relevant details should be a part of a good bug report. You can help
with the following tasks once you have some R programming experience:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Reproducing the bug: If you see a bug report which does not clearly
  explain how to reproduce it, you can try reproducing the bug and
  eventually make things easier for the core developer(s) and/or package
  maintainer(s).
\item
  Checking different binary builds: Check whether the bug occurs on a
  different binary build of R. It is helpful to know whether the bug is
  affecting: \texttt{r-patched}, \texttt{r-devel}, or \texttt{r-release}
  binary builds of R.
\item
  Writing a unit test: If the bug report lacks a unit test that should
  be a part of R's test suite, then you can help with providing it.
\end{enumerate}

These helpful tasks allow the Core developers and/ or maintainers to
classify a bug report properly, so that the bug can be handled in a
timely fashion.

\section{How to find a bug report or an issue to
review?}\label{how-to-find-a-bug-report-or-an-issue-to-review}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  You may search old bug reports or issues that could be closed. Old bug
  reports may no longer be valid or may include a patch that is ready to
  be committed, but no one has had the time to review and commit.
\item
  You might also want to search for issues in topics in which you have a
  working knowledge. When on Bugzilla you can use the advanced search to
  find specific topics. Bug reports are by default public on Bugzilla
  (unless the defaults are changed to avoid security vulnerability).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example of a bug review submitted on
Bugzilla}\label{example-of-a-bug-review-submitted-on-bugzilla}

If you would like to see how bugs are reviewed on Bugzilla, the
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16542}{Bug
16542 - \texttt{nlme:::summary.lmList} with unequal outputs per group}
is an example where an old bug report is being reviewed. It is tested to
see if it was still an issue and a few ways are proposed to resolve the
issue.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, left=2mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, toprule=.15mm, bottomtitle=1mm, toptitle=1mm, bottomrule=.15mm, breakable, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, titlerule=0mm, leftrule=.75mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, arc=.35mm]

There is a \texttt{\#bug-reporting} channel on the
\href{https://r-contributors.slack.com/}{R Contributors slack} where you
can share your bug report(s) for review/feedback before submitting to
Bugzilla. This can help with checking that it really is a bug, that you
have included the important information and excluded redundant
information.

\chapter{Finding the Source}\label{FindSource}

This chapter discusses how you can have an overview of the R codebase.
For instance, where to find the implementation of a base function
written in R and where to find a primitive implementation written in C.
You may want to find the source code of a function just out of curiosity
or maybe to gain more insight into what a particular function is
actually doing. Whatever be the case, reading the source code will help
you to learn a lot about any function.

\section{Finding R source code}\label{finding-r-source-code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Find the R function with the code of interest. You will always be able
  to print the top-level function (or use \texttt{View(function\_name)}
  in RStudio). Looking at the code for the body of this function will
  reveal what you need to do next:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Can already see code of interest: stop here or skip to step 3 to find
  the corresponding file in the R sources.
\item
  Code of interest is in nested R function: go to step 2.
\item
  Top-level function is an S3 generic, identified by a call to
  \texttt{UseMethod()}. Use \texttt{methods(function\_name)} to see
  available methods, then go to step 2.
\item
  Code of interest is in compiled code, identified by a call to
  \texttt{.C()}, \texttt{.Call()}, \texttt{.Fortran()},
  \texttt{.External()}, and \texttt{.External.graphics()}, or
  \texttt{.Internal()} and \texttt{.Primitive()}: go to section on
  compiled code.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Nested functions or S3 methods may not be exported by the package they
  are in. If this is the case, the simplest way to view the code is to
  use \texttt{getAnywhere()} or \texttt{getS3method()}. Now you can keep
  looking at nested R functions till you find the code of interest or
  hit a call to compiled code.
\item
  Find an R function in the R sources. Two options here:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Search on the internet: For R Core packages, search on the GitHub
  mirror (https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn); for recommended packages,
  use the CRAN mirror (https://github.com/cran) - this will link to the
  source on GitHub if available, e.g.~https://github.com/cran/survival.
  Note that GitHub search ignores wildcard characters
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 . , : ; / \ ` ' " = * ! ? # $ & + ^ | ~ < > ( ) { } [ ]
\end{verbatim}

but this does not include \texttt{-} so you can search for a function or
S3 method as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
"body <- function" extension:R
"quantile.ecdf <- function" extension:R
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Search in the R sources using grep: The \hyperref[GetStart]{Getting
  Started} chapter discusses how to download the R sources directly or
  from the svn repository. Now if the sources are in
  \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/R-devel}, you can search as follows:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
grep -R "body <- function" ~/R-devel/src
grep -R "quantile <- function" ~/R-devel/src/library
\end{verbatim}

Note: The above procedure does not cover S4, R6 or RC generics or
methods. Refer
\href{https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source}{accessing R source}
for further details.

\section{Finding C source code}\label{finding-c-source-code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \texttt{.Internal()} or \texttt{.Primitive()}, find entry point in
  \texttt{names.c} as described in the Jenny Bryan's post of
  \href{https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source}{accessing R source}.
  For all other calls to compiled code, you can find the entry point
  from within R. For instance, the body of complete.cases() is
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
.External(C_compcases, ...)
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{C\_compcases} inherits from class ``NativeSymbolInfo'' and we
can extract the name of the entry point via

\begin{verbatim}
stats:::C_compcases$name
\end{verbatim}

We know that it is in the stats package as we see that when we print
complete.cases or look at the help file. This shows us that the entry
point is simply ``compcases'' and in fact that is the general convention
in R code, that you simply remove the \texttt{C\_} prefix (sometimes
\texttt{.F\_} for Fortran code\footnote{Other variations are also
  possible. For example, \texttt{.External.graphics()} calls to C
  functions in the grid package have a \texttt{C\_} prefix in the R
  code, but an \texttt{L\_} prefix in the C code.}) in the name of the
object passed to the first argument of the call.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Once you have the entry point, search as for R code. In the case of
  searching on GitHub, restrict the search to files with the relevant
  extension
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
compcases path:*.c
lowesw path:*.f
\end{verbatim}

similarly for grep

\begin{verbatim}
grep -R --include=*.c "compcases" ~/R-devel/src/library/
\end{verbatim}

Note:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Many editors (like RStudio, ESS) support
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags}{ctags} for code browsing,
  making it easy to jump to definitions of functions.
  \texttt{R\ CMD\ rtags} can generate ctags for any R code (Credit:
  Deepayan Sarkar).
\item
  A more sophisticated system is called GNU GLOBAL, which also supports
  finding all references (calls) to a function.
\item
  GitHub has a code navigation feature via the library tree-sitter.
  Unfortunately, it does not have R support yet. An
  \href{https://github.com/r-lib/tree-sitter-r}{R driver for
  tree-sitter} made by Jim Hester is available.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Lifecycle of a Patch}\label{FixBug}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}

R uses a workflow based on patches. A patch is the set of differences
(additions and deletions) between two versions of code. So you can
create a patch defining a bug fix or a proposed update to the R codebase
and submit it through your official Bugzilla account to the core
developer(s). Be clear in your communication as it is the key to
contributing to any project, especially an open source project like R.

\section{When do you submit a patch?}\label{when-do-you-submit-a-patch}

There might be a situation where you come across a bug in R, which you
may have an idea of how to fix. This can turn out to be an opportunity
for you to submit a patch. By submitting a patch or a bug fix, you are
helping to reduce the workload on the R developers in addition to
yourself being a contributor to R!

When you submit a patch, you are helping the developer(s) and
maintainer(s) so that they do not have to write the entire code from
scratch. Instead, they can test and tweak your patch, if necessary.

\section{What tools are required to submit a
patch?}\label{what-tools-are-required-to-submit-a-patch}

To submit a patch, you need:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{http://subversion.apache.org/}{SVN} installed on your machine.
\item
  The latest developer version of R.
\end{enumerate}

You can retrieve the latest source code of R via:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{export} \VariableTok{TOP\_SRCDIR}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$HOME}\StringTok{/Downloads/R"}
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ checkout https://svn.r{-}project.org/R/trunk/ }\StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Depending on the operative system you might need to do some steps before
that. The different steps required can be found in previous chapters of
the book, for \hyperref[windowsSource]{Windows}, \hyperref[macos]{macOS}
and \hyperref[linux]{Linux}.

\section{How to prepare a patch?}\label{how-to-prepare-a-patch}

If you have the source code in \texttt{\$TOP\_SRCDIR} you can edit the
files, for example a documentation file such as
\texttt{"\$TOP\_SRCDIR"/src/library/stats/man/Multinom.Rd}, to make your
desired changes to that or more files.

Then you should check that R still works as expected via:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{cd} \StringTok{"}\VariableTok{$TOP\_SRCDIR}\StringTok{"}
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ check{-}devel}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If there is no test for your proposed change you can add a new
regression test, following \hyperref[TestRVer]{the guidelines}.

Then you should bring changes from the repository into the working copy,
in case any other change has been introduced, and create a patch.diff
file with just the changes you want to propose to the R core:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ update}
\FunctionTok{svn}\NormalTok{ diff }\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{ patch.diff}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Most often, changes are made to existing files, but if you happen to be
adding a new file in your change, you'll need to run
\texttt{svn\ add\ path/to/file1\ ...} before running \texttt{svn\ diff}
to mark those files for inclusion.

This \texttt{patch.diff} file is the one that can be proposed to the R
core via \hyperref[SubmitPatches]{Bugzilla}. You can also
\hyperref[PatchesReview]{ask for reviews} to the patch before proposing
it to the R core via the
\href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel}{r-devel mailing
list} or the slack channel of the R-contributors space.

\subsection{Using a git mirror}\label{using-a-git-mirror}

Besides checking in your computer, you can use the Github mirror
\href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn}{r-devel/r-svn} of the source
code to check this patch with different configurations and OS.

You should first find the file to edit, via the github interface for
example:

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_file_to_edit.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the heading of the
src/library/stats/man/Mulinom.Rd}

\end{figure}%

Then you can edit it, directly in the interface or using the github
interface:

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_edit_file.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the file src/library/stats/man/Mulinom.Rd being
edited via the Github interface}

\end{figure}%

Create a commit with a message describing the changes

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_commit_message.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the commit message}

\end{figure}%

And create a pull request from the branch created to check the changes.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_commit_pre_PR.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the message when opening a pull requests from the
branch}

\end{figure}%

Add a message and description of the svn for other users and the R core
to know what is the purpose of this modification:

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_PR_message.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the message and content while opening a pull
requests for the r-svn repository}

\end{figure}%%
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_PR_created.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the pull requests opened}

\end{figure}%

Once the PR is submitted, some automatic checks will be triggered (they
might need to be approved by some other users as per Github rules):

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_PR_automatic_checks.png}}
When the checks end you will need to explore the results and asses if
the results indicate a problem or not.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/rsvn_checks_results.png}}

}

\caption{Screenshot of the results of the Github checks in the r-svn
mirror}

\end{figure}%

Once you are happy with the changes and the checks report that
everything is okay you can retrieve the patch via:

\texttt{https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/r-devel/r-svn/pull/\textless{}pull\_request\_number\textgreater{}.diff}

Save \texttt{\textless{}pull\_request\_number\textgreater{}.diff} as a
plain text file to \hyperref[SubmitPatches]{submit your patch}, remember
to check if it meets the \hyperref[GoodPatches]{recommendations for good
patches}.

If you want to use \texttt{git} from the terminal to create the pull
request (PR) to test the changes, you can use this
\href{https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf}{summary
of the available git commands}.

\section{Making good patches}\label{GoodPatches}

When creating a patch for submission, there are several things that you
can do to help ensure that your patch is accepted:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure to follow
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html\#R-coding-standards}{R's
  coding standards} (R is a GNU project and there are GNU coding
  standards). The coding style of the patch you submit should largely
  match with the codebase it is being applied to. If your patch has one
  or two minor discrepancies, then those may be fixed by the core
  developer who will eventually test your patch. However, if there are
  systematic deviations from the style guides your patch will be put on
  hold until you fix the formatting issues. There is no comprehensive
  official R style manual, however some nearly universal standards are
  summarised in
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rockchalk/vignettes/Rstyle.pdf}{this
  article}.
\item
  Be aware of backwards-compatibility considerations. While the core
  developer who eventually handles your patch will make the final call
  on whether something is acceptable, thinking about
  backwards-compatibility early will help prevent having your patch
  rejected on these grounds. Put yourself in the shoes of someone whose
  code will be broken by the change(s) introduced by the patch. It is
  quite likely that any change made will break someone's code, so you
  need to have a good reason to make a change as you will be forcing
  someone to update their code. This obviously does not apply to new
  functions or new arguments. New arguments should be optional and have
  default values which maintain the existing behaviour. If in doubt,
  \hyperref[WhereToGetHelp]{discuss} the issue with experienced
  developers.
\item
  Make sure you have proper tests to verify that your patch works as
  expected. Patches may not be accepted without the proper tests.
\item
  Make sure the entire test suite runs without failure because of your
  changes. It is not sufficient to only run whichever test seems
  impacted by your changes, because there might be interactions unknown
  to you between your changes and some other part of the interpreter.
\item
  Proper documentation additions/changes should be included.
\item
  Each bugfix should ideally be addressed by a single patch. In
  particular, do not fix more than one issue in the same patch (except,
  if one code change fixes all of them) and do not do cosmetic changes
  to unrelated code in the same patch as some bugfix.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Submitting your patch for review}\label{SubmitPatches}

\subsection{Patch in response to a pre-existing issue or bug
report}\label{patch-in-response-to-a-pre-existing-issue-or-bug-report}

In this case, you should attach the patch to the existing issue or bug
report on Bugzilla with a brief comment.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Use the Attachments option to add the \texttt{*.diff} file as
  attachment.
\item
  On the new Create New Attachment web page, add a Brief Decription.
\item
  Select Content Type as \texttt{patch}.
\item
  Add comments (often prose text) in this page rather than in the
  original bugzilla page for the PR.
\item
  Press Submit. This will give you a bugzilla submission that sends one
  e-mail to all of R-core plus the PR author.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Patch in response to an unreported issue or bug
report}\label{patch-in-response-to-an-unreported-issue-or-bug-report}

Assuming you already performed a search on Bugzilla for a pre-existing
issue or bug and did not find the issue or bug reported, you need to
create a new bug report and include your patch with it. Please fill in
as much relevant detail as possible to prevent reviewers from having to
delay reviewing your patch because of lack of information. Include
(mostly as the first sentence), a to-the-point explanation of what the
purpose of the patch is. This sentence should not be in the descriptive
form, rather an imperative form will be more suitable here. If this is
not enough detail for a patch, a new paragraphs(s) can be added to
explain in proper depth what has happened. The details should be good
enough that a core developer reading it understands the justification
for the change.

\section{Getting your patch reviewed}\label{PatchesReview}

To begin with, please be patient. There are many more people submitting
patches than there are people capable of reviewing your patches. Getting
your patch reviewed requires a reviewer to have the spare time and
motivation to look at your patch. We cannot force anyone to review
patches and no one is employed to look at patches.

There is a \texttt{\#patches-for-review} channel on the
\href{https://r-contributors.slack.com/}{R Contributors slack} where you
can share your patch(es) for review/feedback before submitting to
R-Core/Bugzilla. This can help with checking that you have included the
important information and excluded redundant information.

If your patch has not received any notice from reviewers (i.e., no
comment made) after one month, comment/message on the
\texttt{\#patches-for-review} channel to remind the members that the
patch needs a review.

When someone does manage to find the time to look at your patch they
will most likely make comments about how it can be improved. It is then
expected that you update your patch to address these comments, and the
review process will thus iterate until a satisfactory solution has
emerged.

\subsection{How to review a patch?}\label{how-to-review-a-patch}

One of the bottlenecks in the R development process is the lack of code
reviews. If you browse Bugzilla, you will see that numerous issues have
a fix, but cannot be merged into the main source code repository,
because no one has reviewed the proposed solution. Reviewing a patch can
be just as informative as providing a patch and it will allow you to
give constructive comments on another developer's work. This guide
provides a checklist for submitting a patch review. It is a common
misconception that in order to be useful, a patch review has to be
perfect. This is not the case at all. It is helpful to just test the
patch and/or play around with the code and leave comments in the patch
or on Bugzilla.

If a bug report or an issue has a patch attached that has not been
reviewed, you can help by making sure that the patch:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  follows the style guides;
\item
  is a good solution to the problem it is trying to solve;
\item
  includes proper tests; and
\item
  includes proper documentation changes.
\end{itemize}

Also refer to \hyperref[GoodPatches]{Making good patches} for more
ideas. Doing all of this allows the core developer(s) and/ or
maintainer(s) to more quickly look for subtle issues that only people
with extensive experience working on R's codebase will notice.

\section{Leaving a patch review on
Bugzilla}\label{leaving-a-patch-review-on-bugzilla}

When you review a patch, you should provide additional details and
context of your review process and leave comments. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you tested the patch, report the result and the system and version
  tested on, such as `Windows 10', `Ubuntu 16.4', or `Mac High Sierra'.
\item
  If you request changes, try to suggest how or attach an updated patch.
\item
  Comment on what is `good' about the patch, not just the `bad'. Doing
  so will make it easier for the patch author to find the good in your
  comments.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dismissing review from another core
developer}\label{dismissing-review-from-another-core-developer}

A core developer can dismiss another core developer's review if they
confirmed that the requested changes have been made. When a core
developer has assigned the patch to themselves, then it is a sign that
they are actively looking after the patch, and their review should not
be dismissed.

\section{Acceptance or rejection of your
patch}\label{acceptance-or-rejection-of-your-patch}

Once your patch has reached an acceptable state, it will either be
applied or rejected. If it is rejected, please do not take it
personally. Your work is still appreciated regardless of whether your
patch is applied. Balancing what does and does not go into R is tricky
and everyone's contributions cannot always be accepted.

But if your patch is accepted and applied it will then go on to be
released with the next patched release and eventually the next major
release of R. It may also be backported to older versions of R as a
bugfix if the core developer doing the patch acceptance believes it is
warranted.

It may take longer before your patch is accepted and applied or
rejected, sometimes even months or years. Nonetheless, it is appreciated
that you submitted a patch.

\chapter{Documenting}\label{Doc}

R has a substantial body of documentation, comprising help files for the
core packages and a set of manuals aimed at users (An Introduction to R,
R Data Import/Export), system administrators (R Installation and
Administration) and developers (Writing R Extensions, The R language
definition, and R Internals). This documentation was developed by the R
Core Team with input from external contributors. The continuing
involvement of the user community is important in maintaining this
valuable documentation.

The involvement of the community takes many forms, from contributing
content, to making bug reports or raising an issue when the
documentation could be more complete or made easier to follow.

This chapter is about the ways people can contribute to R's
documentation, with guidance on how to do that. Any time you feel that
you can clarify or fill gaps in existing documentation, your
contribution is welcome and appreciated. If you find it difficult to
deal with the markup formatting language used in the source files, you
can ask for help with that part too. Please do not let the material in
this chapter stand between the documentation and your desire to help
out. However, not every good faith effort to change or extend the
documentation will be accepted - sometimes the suggested changes may be
incorrect; other times, while a change in wording may make some things
clearer and easier to understand, the finer details of some corner case
may become less clear, leading to the suggested changes being declined
or modified by a member of R Core before applying them (if they agree
the issue is important enough to fix).

\section{Helping with documentation}\label{helping-with-documentation}

Maintaining the accuracy of R's documentation and keeping a high level
of quality takes a lot of effort. Community members, like you, help with
writing, editing, and updating content, and these contributions are
appreciated and welcomed.

Looking at pre-existing documentation source files can be very helpful
when getting started.

You can directly search for
\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?component=Documentation&list_id=22501&product=R&resolution=---}{documentation
issues/bugs on Bugzilla}. Issues vary from typos to unclear
documentation and items lacking documentation.

If you see a documentation issue that you would like to tackle, you can
leave a comment on the issue saying you are going to try to solve the
issue and mention roughly how long you think you will take to do so
(this allows others to take on the issue if you happen to forget or lose
interest).

\section{Reporting documentation
bugs}\label{reporting-documentation-bugs}

To suggest improvements to the R manuals, report typos or bugs in the R
manuals, or to raise issues related to documentation in packages
maintained by the R Core Team, follow the usual guidance for
\hyperref[RCorePkgBug]{reporting bugs in R}.

To report bugs or typos in the documentation of a package that is not
maintained by the R Core Team, follow the guidance for
\hyperref[nonRCorePkgBug]{reporting bugs in contributed packages}.

\textbf{Note}:

There is a \texttt{\#core-documentation} channel on the
\href{https://r-contributors.slack.com/}{R Contributors slack} where you
can get feedback before reporting an issue or get feedback on proposed
improvements.

\subsection{Example documentation
bugs}\label{example-documentation-bugs}

Here are a couple of successfully resolved bugs as examples.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16003}{Bug 16003 -
  heatmap scale argument: description not complete}
\end{enumerate}

There was a question about the description in the documentation, where
it wasn't technically incorrect, but was slightly unclear. This led to a
discussion around the updates to the text and a couple of extra examples
were added in for clarity too.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18781}{Bug 18781 -
  typo in texinfo}
\end{enumerate}

This is an example of a typo being spotted, raised and fixed within the
same day.

\section{Guidelines for writing R help
files}\label{guidelines-for-writing-r-help-files}

This section is based on the
\href{https://developer.r-project.org/Rds.html}{guidelines used by R
Core developers for writing R help files}. Extensive details of writing
R documentation files can be found in the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html\#Writing-R-documentation-files}{Writing
R Extensions} manual.

The language used in the documentations should follow these basic rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Affirmative tone should be used to describe what the function does and
  how to use it effectively. Rather than creating worry in the mind of a
  reader, it should establish confident knowledge about the effective
  use of the particular function/feature.
\item
  More documentation is not necessarily better documentation. Long
  descriptions full of corner cases and caveats can create the
  impression that a function is more complex or harder to use than it
  actually is. Be succinct but exhaustive.
\item
  Short code examples can help in understanding better. Readers can
  often grasp a simple example more quickly than they can digest a
  formal description. Usually people learn faster with concrete,
  motivating examples that match the context of a typical use case.
\item
  Giving a code equivalent (or approximate equivalent) can be a useful
  addition to the description provided. You should carefully weigh
  whether the code equivalent adds value to the document.
\item
  The tone of the documentation needs to be respectful of the reader's
  background. Lay out the relevant information, show motivating use
  cases, provide glossary links, and do your best to connect-the-dots.
  The documentation is meant for newcomers, many of whom will be using
  it to evaluate the R language as a whole. The experience needs to be
  positive and not leave the reader with worries that something bad will
  happen if they make a mistake.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Introduction to \texttt{.Rd}
files}{Introduction to .Rd files}}\label{introduction-to-.rd-files}

The R help files are written in ``R documentation'' (Rd) format, a
markup language which resembles LaTeX. The \texttt{.Rd} file format can
be further processed into a variety of formats, including LaTeX, HTML,
and plain text. The \texttt{.Rd} files can be found in the \texttt{man}
directory of the source code for the corresponding package.

There are three main parts of an \texttt{.Rd} file:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Header}: This part is for the basic information of the
  document/file. For instance, the name of the file, the topics
  documented, a title, a short textual description, and R usage
  information for the objects documented.
\item
  \textbf{Body}: This part includes further information on the
  function's arguments and return value.
\item
  \textbf{Footer}: This part is optional. Usually the keyword
  information is included here.
\end{enumerate}

All the above information is included in a \texttt{.Rd} file within a
series of sections with standard names (user-defined sections are also
allowed). These sections are discussed below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}title} section:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Capitalize each word.
  \item
    Do not end in a period.
  \item
    Avoid use of markup language (because markup language need not be
    suitable for various hypertext search systems).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}usage} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}examples}
  sections:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Line length of 65 characters is advised.
  \item
    Use \texttt{TRUE} instead of \texttt{T} and \texttt{FALSE} instead
    of \texttt{F}.
  \item
    Add spaces around binary operators.
  \item
    Add spaces after commas in the argument lists.
  \item
    Use \texttt{\textless{}-} rather than \texttt{=} for assignments.
  \item
    Add spaces around the \texttt{\textless{}-} operator.
  \item
    Do not use tabs to indent (as these do not render correctly on all
    possible pagers).
  \item
    Use 4 spaces to indent the (example) code.
  \item
    Make sure the examples are directly executable.
  \item
    The examples should be system-independent.
  \item
    The examples should not require special facilities (for instance,
    Internet access or write permission to specific directories).
  \item
    Examples should also not take longer than necessary to run, as they
    are run when checking a build of R.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}source} and
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}references} sections:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Author(s) names should be written in the form
    \texttt{Author,\ A.\ B.}.
  \item
    Author(s) names should be separated by a comma or \texttt{and} (but
    not both).
  \item
    Separate paragraphs (separated by a blank line) should be used for
    each reference.
  \item
    Give a date immediately after the author(s) names.
  \item
    Do not put a period after the date.
  \item
    Titles of books and journals (not articles) should be enclosed in
    \texttt{\textbackslash{}emph\{...\}}.
  \item
    Volume numbers for journals are to be enclosed in
    \texttt{\textbackslash{}bold\{...\}} and followed by a comma.
  \item
    Use \texttt{-\/-} for page ranges.
  \item
    For giving an address for a publisher use the format
    \texttt{New\ York:\ Springer-Verlag}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

For example, the help file for \texttt{base::mean()} is found at
\url{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/man/mean.Rd}.
The file\texttt{mean.Rd} has the content shown below:

Many R package developers write help files using the R package
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2}{roxygen2}, which
generates \texttt{.Rd} files from comments in the corresponding
\texttt{.R} files. However, in this guide we only consider \texttt{.Rd}
files, because the help files for the base distribution are written and
edited directly in \texttt{.Rd} format.

\section{R manuals}\label{r-manuals}

The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html}{R manuals} are a part
of the \href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/doc/manual/}{R sources}.
Hence, bug reports/patches can also be submitted via Bugzilla,
e.g.~\href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15221}{Bug
15221 - R-admin/`Installing R under Windows': Missing argument name}.
Note that they are typically referred to by their file names as listed
below:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

\end{itemize}

\section{Proofreading}\label{proofreading}

While an issue filed on Bugzilla means there is a known issue somewhere,
that does not mean there are not other issues lurking about in the
documentation. Proofreading a part of the documentation can often
uncover problems.

If you decide to proofread, read a section of the documentation from
start to finish, filing issues in Bugzilla for each major type of
problem you find. It is best to avoid filing a single issue for an
entire section containing multiple problems; instead, file several
issues so that it is easier to break the work up for multiple people and
more efficient review.

\section{Helping with the R Development
Guide}\label{helping-with-the-r-development-guide}

The R Development Guide (what you are reading now) uses the same process
as the main R documentation, except for some small differences. The
source lives in a \href{https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide/}{GitHub
repository} and bug reports should be submitted to the
\href{https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide/issues}{devguide GitHub
tracker}.

There's a section on the introduction page detailing
\hyperref[how-to-contribute-to-this-guide]{how to contribute to this
guide}. Once you have made suggested changes you can raise them for
someone else to review through a
\href{https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests}{pull
request} on GitHub. Examples of past pull requests can be found on the
\href{https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide/pulls?q=is\%3Apr+is\%3Aclosed}{pull
request tab in this guide's GitHub repository}. Our workflow for the R
Development Guide uses continuous integration and deployment so changes
to the live R Development Guide site are normally published once a pull
request is merged.

\chapter{Message Translations}\label{message-translations}

This chapter covers internationalization in R, i.e., the display of
messages in languages other than English. All output in R (such as
messages emitted by \texttt{stop()}, \texttt{warning()}, or
\texttt{message()}) is eligible for translation, as are menu labels in
the GUI. Depending on the version of R that you are using, some of the
languages might already be available while others may need work. R
leverages the
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/}{\texttt{gettext}} program
to handle the conversion from English to arbitrary target languages.

Having messages available in other languages can be an important bridge
for R learners not confident in English -- rather than learning two
things at once (coding in R and processing diagnostic information in
English), they can focus on coding while getting more natural
errors/warnings in their native tongue.

The
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/index.html}{\texttt{gettext}
manual} is a more canonical reference for a deep understanding of how
\texttt{gettext} works. This chapter will just give a broad overview,
with particular focus on how things work for R, with the goal of making
it as low-friction as possible for developers and users to contribute
new/updated translations.

\section{How translations work}\label{how-translations-work}

Each of the default packages distributed with R (i.e., those found in
\texttt{./src/library} such as \texttt{base}, \texttt{utils}, and
\texttt{stats} and which have priority base) contains a \texttt{po}
directory. A \texttt{po} directory is the central location for
ataloguing/translating each package's messages. It contains a template
message file (\texttt{.pot}) for the corresponding ackage along with
translated \texttt{.po} files (that are created using the template
\texttt{.pot} file).

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{.pot}
files}{.pot files}}\label{pot-files}

A \texttt{.pot} file is a template file found inside the \texttt{po}
directory of an R package. This template file is a snapshot of the
messages available in a given \textbf{domain}. A domain in R typically
identifies a source package and a source language (either R or C/C++).
For example, the file \texttt{R-stats.pot} (found in the R sources in
\texttt{./src/library/stats/po}) is a catalogue of all messages produced
by R code in the \texttt{stats} package, while \texttt{stats.pot} is a
catalogue of all messages produced by C code in the \texttt{stats}
package.

The `base' package has two exceptions to the basic pattern described
above. The first is the domain for messages produced by the C code which
is the fundamental backing of R itself (especially, but not exclusively,
the C code under ./src/main{[}\^{}The file \texttt{./po/POTFILES} is the
canonical source of files searched. Note that while, technically, it is
possible to support translations in Fortran code, R does not currently
do so. Only a handful of messages are produced by Fortran routines in
the R sources.{]}). The associated \texttt{.pot} file is \texttt{R.pot}
and is found in \texttt{./src/library/base/po}.
R-base.pot\texttt{is\ a\ normal}.pot\texttt{file\ because\ base\ has\ a\ normal}R`
directory.

The second is the domain for the Windows R GUI, i.e., the text in the
menus and elsewhere in the R GUI program available for running R on
Windows. These messages are stored in the \texttt{RGui.pot} domain, also
in the \texttt{po} directory for \texttt{base}, and are most commonly
derived from C code found in \texttt{./src/gnuwin32}. One reason to keep
this domain separate is that it is only relevant to one platform
(Windows). In particular, Windows has historically different character
encodings, so that it made more sense for Windows developers to produce
translations specifically or Windows, since it is non-trivial for
non-Windows users to test their translations for the Windows GUI.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Generating \texttt{.pot}
files}{Generating .pot files}}\label{generating-.pot-files}

For outside contributors, there's no need to update .pot files --
translators will typically take the R \texttt{.pot} files as given and
generate \texttt{.po} files. These will be sent along to a
language-specific translation maintainer, who then compiles them to send
to the R Core developer responsible for translations, who finally
applies them as a patch.

To emphasize, this section is almost always not needed for contributing
translations -- it is here for completeness and edification.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{.po}
files}{.po files}}\label{po-files}

.po files are the most important artifacts for translators. They provide
the (human-readable!) mapping between the messages as they appear in the
source code and how the messages will appear to users in translated
locales.

\subsubsection{Singular messages}\label{singular-messages}

Most messages appear as \texttt{msgid}/\texttt{msgstr} pairs. The former
gives the message as it appears in the code, while the latter shows how
it should appear in translation. For example, here is an error in German
(locale: \texttt{de}) informing the user that their input must be of
class \texttt{POSIXt}

\begin{verbatim}
msgid "'to' must be a \"POSIXt\" object"
msgstr "'to' muss ein \"POSIXt\" Objekt sein"
\end{verbatim}

See this in context in the
\href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/po/R-de.po}{\texttt{R-de.po}
source file}.

The same message can also be found in
\href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/po/R-it.po}{\texttt{R-it.po}}
giving the translation to Italian:

\begin{verbatim}
msgid "'to' must be a \"POSIXt\" object"
msgstr "'to' dev'essere un oggetto \"POSIXt\""
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Plural messages}\label{plural-messages}

Some messages will have different translations depending on some input
determined at run time (e.g., the \texttt{length()} of an input object
or the \texttt{nrow()} of a \texttt{data.frame}). This presents a
challenge for translation, because different languages have different
rules for how to pluralize different ordinal numbers{[}\^{}See the
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Plural-forms.html}{relevant
section} of the \texttt{gettext} manual{]}. For example, English
typically adds \texttt{s} to any quantity of items besides 1 (1 dog, 2
dog\texttt{s}, 100 dog\texttt{s}, even 0 dog\texttt{s}). Chinese
typically does not alter the word itself in similar situations (ä¸åªç,
ä¸¤åªç, ä¸ç¾åªç, é¶åªç); Arabic has \emph{six} different ways to
pluralize a quantity.

In \texttt{.po} files, this shows up in the form of
\texttt{msgid\_plural} entries, followed by several ordered
\texttt{msgstr} entries. Here's an example from
\href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/c715d61cb74b3fee2d035faed9b258e86e420b75/src/library/base/po/R-de.po\#L2015-L2018}{\texttt{R-de.po}}\footnote{The
  GitHub mirror of the \href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/}{actual
  svn repo} is linked in this chapter as it is a better interface for
  browsing the source files.}:

\begin{verbatim}
msgid "Warning message:\n"
msgid_plural "Warning messages:\n"
msgstr[0] "Warnmeldung:\n"
msgstr[1] "Warnmeldungen:\n"
\end{verbatim}

The two entries in English correspond to the singular and plural
messages; the two entries in German correspond similarly, because
pluralization rules in German are similar to those in English. The
situation in Lithuanian
(\href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/c715d61cb74b3fee2d035faed9b258e86e420b75/src/library/base/po/R-lt.po\#L1999-L2003}{\texttt{R-lt.po}})
is more divergent:

\begin{verbatim}
msgid "Warning message:\n"
msgid_plural "Warning messages:\n"
msgstr[0] "Ä®spÄjantis praneÅ¡imas:\n"
msgstr[1] "Ä®spÄjantys praneÅ¡imai:\n"
msgstr[2] "Ä®spÄjanÄiÅ³ praneÅ¡imÅ³:\n"
\end{verbatim}

This corresponds to the 3 different ways to pluralize words in Polish.

What do \texttt{0}, \texttt{1}, and \texttt{2} correspond to, exactly?
Ideally, this will be clear to native speakers of the language, but for
clarity, it is the solution to a small arithmetic problem that can be
found in the language's metadata entry. Look for the
\texttt{Plural-Forms} entry in the metadata at the top of the
\texttt{.po} file;
\href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/c715d61cb74b3fee2d035faed9b258e86e420b75/src/library/base/po/R-lt.po\#L18-L19}{here
it is for Lithuanian}:

\begin{verbatim}
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=(n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && (n"
"%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2);\n"
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{nplurals} tells us how many entries correspond to each
\texttt{msgid\_plural} for this language. \texttt{plural} tells us, for
the quantity \texttt{n}, which entry to use. The arithmetic is C code;
most important if you really want to parse this and are only familiar
with R code is C's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\%3F:}{ternary
operator}: \texttt{test\ ?\ valueIfTrue\ :\ valueIfFalse} is a handy way
to write R's \texttt{if\ (test)\ valueIfTrue\ else\ valueIfFalse}.

Parsing, we get the following associations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \texttt{0} entry corresponds to when a number equals 1 modulo 10
  (i.e., 1, 11, 21, 31, \ldots) \emph{except} numbers equaling 11 modulo
  100 (i.e., 11, 111, 211, 311, \ldots). Combining, that's 1, 21, 31,
  \ldots, 91, 101, 121, 131, \ldots, 191, \ldots{}
\item
  the \texttt{1} entry corresponds to numbers at least 2 modulo 10 (2,
  3, \ldots, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, \ldots) and \emph{either} below 10 modulo
  100 (0, 1, \ldots, 9, 100, 101, \ldots, 109, \ldots) \emph{or}
  exceeding 20 modulo 100 (21, 22, \ldots, 99). Combining, that's 2, 3,
  \ldots, 9, 22, 23, \ldots, 29, 32, 33, \ldots{} 39, \ldots, 102, 103,
  \ldots, 109, 122, 123, \ldots{}
\item
  The \texttt{2} entry corresponds to all other numbers, i.e.~0, 10, 11,
  12, \ldots, 19, 20, 30, \ldots, 90, 100, 110, 111, 112, \ldots{}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{.mo}
files}{.mo files}}\label{mo-files}

\texttt{.po} files are plain text, but while helpful for human readers,
this is inefficient for consumption by computers. The .mo format is a
``compiled'' version of the .po file optimized for retrieving messages
when R is running.

In R-devel, the conversion from .po to .mo is done by R Core -- you
don't need to compile these files yourself. They are stored in the R
sources at \texttt{./src/library/translations/inst} in various
language-specific subdirectories.

\section{How to contribute new
translations}\label{how-to-contribute-new-translations}

Translating R into different languages helps make it more user-friendly
for non-English speakers and helps to grow the R community. See the blog
post on how
\href{https://blog.r-project.org/2022/07/25/r-can-use-your-help-translating-r-messages}{R
can use your help: Translating R messages}.

To get started contributing to translations, please follow the steps
below:

\textbf{Step 1: Register an Account at Weblate}

Weblate is an open-source platform for collaborative translation of
software projects. Register an account on R's Weblate server,
\url{https://translate.rx.studio/}, to start contributing.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Note: To get started follow the detailed workflow and convention
for translation which is given here:
\url{https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/}}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Step 2: Choose a Component and Language}

Select a component of R with less than 100\% translation. Each component
corresponds to the messages in either the R code or the C code of one of
the packages in base R, e.g.~base (R files), or tools (C files). There
is one special case: base (R GUI), which corresponds to the messages in
the Windows Graphical User Interface.

After selecting a component, you can select your preferred language.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/translate_component.png}}

\textbf{Step 3: Translate the Message}

Now, you can click on Translate button on your right.

\begin{quote}
Note: More information for String status visit:
\url{https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/workflows.html\#translation-states}
\end{quote}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/translate_button.png}}

Then, start translating the message by typing the translation in the
text box.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/translate_string_and_save.png}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If you are \textbf{confident} that the \textbf{translation is
  correct}, make sure the ``Needs editing'' box is \textbf{unchecked}.
\item
  If you are \textbf{unsure} about how to translate, write the
  translation as a \textbf{Suggest} button instead.
\item
  Finally, Click \textbf{``Save and Continue''} to save the translation
  and continue.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note:} Use Glossary feature within Weblate making translation
easy and consistent:
\url{https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/glossary/}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Note:} Make sure to use Automatic Suggestions as a starting
point.
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Click on Automatic Suggestions (machine translation)
\item
  Accept it if you think the automatic suggestion looks good
\end{enumerate}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/auto-suggestion.png}}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Some Tips to follow:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Be consistent:} Use the same words and phrases throughout the
  translation to make it consistent and avoid confusion.
\item
  \textbf{Check for technical issues:} After finishing the translation,
  check if you have any alerts or warning in the Weblate string status,
  e.g.~double instead of single space.
\item
  \textbf{Follow language specific guidelines:} Check how other
  languages have translated the string. Even if you are not fluent in
  another language it can give you an idea of how other translators have
  handled it, especially which parts are left verbatim. A detailed guide
  is given here :
  \href{https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/Conventions_for_Languages/\#languages-and-contributions}{Conventions-for-translations\#languages-and-contributions}
\end{itemize}

\section{Bulk Translations}\label{bulk-translations}

Instead of translating one string at a time, it is possible to bulk
translate a whole component of R at once:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Navigate to the translations for a particular component in a
  particular language,
  e.g.~https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/base-c/ar/
\item
  Select \textbf{`Tools \textgreater{} Automatic translation'}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/translate_automatic_translation.png}}

}

\caption{Tools drop-down menu with ``Automatic Translations'' selected}

\end{figure}%

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  In the dialog,
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  under \textbf{`Automatic translation mode'}, select \textbf{`Add as
  ``needing edit''\,'}\footnote{By selecting \textbf{`Add as ``needing
    edit''\,'}, the autotranslated strings would be treated as ``fuzzy''
    translations, i.e.~they would be added to the component source files
    when a patch is made, but they would NOT be used.}:
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  under \textbf{`Search filter'}, select \textbf{`Untranslated strings'}
\item
  under \textbf{`Source of automated translations'}, select
  \textbf{`Machine translation'}
\item
  under \textbf{`Machine translation engines'}, select
  \textbf{`Microsoft Translator'}\footnote{Microsoft Translator is
    preferred for bulk translation as our free tier covers 2 million
    characters/month, where DeepL only allows 500k chars/month. If
    Microsoft Translator translations are much worse than DeepL, it may
    be useful to use it to translate one string at a time.}:
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapters/img/translate_dialog.png}}

}

\caption{Automatic Translations dialog box}

\end{figure}%

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Review the translations, edit as necessary and uncheck
  \textbf{``needing edit''}.

\chapter{Testing Pre-release R Versions}\label{TestRVer}

This chapter is inspired from the blog on
\href{https://blog.r-project.org/2021/04/28/r-can-use-your-help-testing-r-before-release/index.html}{testing
R before release} and discusses how you can help with testing of
pre-release versions of R.

\section{Where to test?}\label{where-to-test}

Whenever possible use a fresh package library for testing, even better
would be to use \hyperref[VM]{virtual machines} for the testing. This
would ensure that you do not damage your existing R installation.

\subsection{Virtual machine}\label{VM}

A free Windows 10 virtual machine is provided by Microsoft (with a
90-day limit) for building, testing, and checking R packages and R
itself. Package maintainers who work on Linux and MacOS can use it to
test their packages on Windows. Read the
\href{https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/vm.html}{instructions}
on how to automatically set up the machine to check R packages. Tomas
Kalibera describes the details of using virtual machine in the blog
\href{https://blog.r-project.org/2021/03/18/virtual-windows-machine-for-checking-r-packages/index.html}{Virtual
Windows machine for checking R packages}.

\section{What can you test?}\label{what-can-you-test}

You can test:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Your own programs.
\item
  Your own workflows.
\item
  Your special ways of installing or setting up R.
\item
  Things that interact with external libraries.
\item
  Interactive R packages.
\end{itemize}

Details of performing testing on various operating systems:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://blog.r-project.org/2021/04/28/r-can-use-your-help-testing-r-before-release/index.html\#on-windows}{Windows}
\item
  \href{https://blog.r-project.org/2021/04/28/r-can-use-your-help-testing-r-before-release/index.html\#on-macos}{macOS}
\item

\item
  \href{https://blog.r-project.org/2021/04/28/r-can-use-your-help-testing-r-before-release/index.html\#on-solaris}{Solaris}
\end{itemize}

\section{Writing tests for R}\label{writing-tests-for-r}

Writing tests for R is much like writing tests for your own code. Tests
need to be thorough, fast, isolated, consistently repeatable, and as
simple as possible.

When you are adding tests to an existing test file, it is also
recommended that you study the other tests in that file; it will teach
you which precautions you have to take to make your tests robust and
portable. We try to have tests both for normal behaviour and for error
conditions. Tests live in the \texttt{tests} directory.

\section{Benchmarks}\label{benchmarks}

Benchmarking is useful to test that a change does not degrade
performance.

\chapter{Where to Get Help}\label{WhereToGetHelp}

If you are working on R it is possible that you will come across an
issue where you would need some assistance to solve it. If you require
help, there are options available to seek assistance or get some
feedback which are discussed in this chapter. If the question involves
process or tool usage then please check the rest of this guide first as
it should answer your question. Please make sure to search the
documentation and resources to see if your question has already been
addressed. If not, then ask for assistance in the appropriate forum.
Many developers are volunteers and please be polite, patient, and
thoughtful when requesting for feedback or help.

\section{Slack}\label{slack}

You can discuss issues related to the development of R and learn about
the process of contributing to R on the
\href{https://r-contributors.slack.com/}{R Contributors slack}. There
are a number of experienced developers on this slack who can answer
questions and/or provide feedback. The following channels are available
on the R-devel slack for help and feedback with specific areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \#bugreports-for-review: Share bug reports for review/feedback before
  submitting to Bugzilla.
\item
  \#core-dev-help: Getting help on anything related to R Core
  contribution.
\item
  \#core-documentation: Discuss patches/improvements to R's
  documentation.
\item
  \#core-translation: Discuss translating R messages, warnings, and
  errors into non-English languages.
\item
  \#patches-for-review: Share patches for peer review before submitting
  to R Core.
\end{itemize}

Note: You may not be able to access the history of these channels, so it
cannot be used as a knowledge base of sorts.

\chapter{Developer Tools}\label{DevTools}

This chapter lists resources and tools which R developers may use. Here
we will go over some commonly used tools that are relevant to R's
workflow. As there are several ways to accomplish these tasks, this
chapter reflects methods suitable for new contributors. Experienced
contributors may desire a different approach.

\section{Subversion (svn) client}\label{subversion-svn-client}

Subversion (svn) is a version control system that tracks any changes
made to files and directories. You can install either the
\href{https://tortoisesvn.net/}{TortoiseSVN} (command line tool, and
Windows Explorer integration) or the
\href{https://sliksvn.com/download/}{SlikSVN} (just the command line
tool) client. They have Windows installers and can be used from Windows
cmd or RStudio terminal.
