For this reason we have a TOP_SRCDIR variable where the source code goes and the variable BUILDDIR where the built R version will go.\n\n2.3.1 Linux\nHere are the basic steps intended as a checklist. For complete instructions please see the section in R-admin.\n\nRetrieve R source code via into TOP_SRCDIR, note that we retrieve the r-devel source code:\nexport TOP_SRCDIR=\"$HOME/Downloads/R\"\nsvn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"\nDownload the latest recommended packages2:\n\"$TOP_SRCDIR/tools/rsync-recommended\"\nCreate the build directory in the BUILDDIR:\nexport BUILDDIR=\"$HOME/bin/R\"\nmkdir -p \"$BUILDDIR\"\ncd \"$BUILDDIR\"\nConfigure the R installation (with --enable-R-shlib so that RStudio IDE can use it):\n\"$TOP_SRCDIR/configure\" --enable-R-shlib\nBuild R :\nmake\nCheck that R works as expected:\nmake check\nThere are other checks you can run:\nmake check-devel\nmake check-recommended\n\nIf we don’t want to build R in a different directory than the source code we can simply use:\ncd \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"\nsvn update\ntools/rsync-recommended\n\"$TOP_SRCDIR/configure\"  --enable-R-shlib\nmake \nmake check\nOnce you successfully built R from source you can modify the R source code to fix an issue: Prepare a patch (See this guide) and after checking that R works as intended (make check-devel) submit the patch for consideration by R Core. (See the lifecycle of a patch chapter).\nTo use the r-devel version in RStudio, you can do the following:\nexport RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=\"$BUILDDIR/bin/R\"\ncd \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"\nrstudio\n\n\n2.3.2 Windows\n\n2.3.2.1 Binaries\nThe binary builds of R for Windows can be downloaded and installed from here. Along with the link to the latest stable release, this page also contains links to the binary builds of r-patched and r-devel.\n\nClick on the download links to download an executable installer.\nSelect the language while installing, read the GNU general public license information, and select the destination location to start the installation. You will be prompted to select components at this stage: User installation, 64-bit User installation, or Custom installation. The default option may be chosen for the questions from this step onwards to complete the installation.\n\nDaily binaries for r-devel are made available for download and installation.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 From source\nBefore installing R from source, some additional programs are needed, as per the latest documentation:\n\nRtools is the suggested toolchain bundle for building R base and R packages containing compiled code on Windows. The latest version of Rtools can be installed using the Rtools installer rtools44-XXXX-XXX.exe.\nA LaTeX compiler is needed to install and build R, check packages and build manuals. On CRAN, MiKTeX is used, which can be downloaded from https://miktex.org. Once installed open MiKTeX via the Windows start menu. It might ask to check for updates and more importantly, to make it available in PATH. You can accept both.\nOpen the Rtools44 terminal to update and install subversion:\npacman -Syuu\npacman -Sy wget subversion\nRetrieve the latest source code via subversion:\nexport TOP_SRCDIR=\"$HOME/Downloads/R\"\nsvn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"\nIf you already have the repository available you can update as:\ncd $TOP_SRCDIR\nsvn update\nYou can also use a SVN client such as TortoiseSVN (https://tortoisesvn.net/, command line tool, and Windows Explorer integration) or SlikSVN (https://sliksvn.com/download/, just the command line tool) so that it can be also found by other tools.\nDownload the latest tcl/tk and unzip it in $TOP_SRCDIR:\ncd \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"\nwget -np -nd -r -l1 -A 'tcltk-*.zip' https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/\nunzip \"tcltk-*.zip\"\nAdd gcc, MiKTeX and tar to the PATH and set one tar option:\nexport PATH=\"/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:$PATH\"\nexport PATH=\"/c/Program Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH\"\nexport TAR=\"/usr/bin/tar\"\nexport TAR_OPTIONS=\"--force-local\"\nIf MiKTeX was installed just for your user you might need to run:\nexport PATH=\"/c/Users/$USER/AppData/Local/Programs/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH\"\nCheck that all the programs can be found:\nwhich make gcc pdflatex tar\nIf there is any error you’ll need to find where the program is installed and add the corresponding path.\nDownload the latest recommended packages3:\ncd \"$TOP_SRCDIR/src/gnuwin32/\"\n\"$TOP_SRCDIR/tools/rsync-recommended\"\nBuild R and the recommended packages:\nmake all recommended\nThe recently compiled version of R will be at $TOP_SRCDIR/bin/. In RStudio you can select that folder and restart it to use the r-devel version.\nCheck that R works as expected:\nmake check\nThere are other checks you can run for testing the successful installation of the recommended packages:\nmake check-devel\nmake check-recommended\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 macOS\nThis section will be added after the official installation instructions for macOS in the R installation and administration manual have been updated for R 4.4.0.",

Report either of which needs to be fixed.\n\n\n\nMake sure whether the bug appears in a clean session of R. Many times, there are variables/commands/functions stored in the workspace which might cause issues. Hence, check if the issue happens in a clean session. To do so, launch R from the command line with the --vanilla option.\nAt times the code that is written is very complicated, has numerous package and file dependencies, has many function calls, etc.. In such scenarios it is quite common that the code throws an error and you are not able to solve it. You may tend to think that there is a bug that needs to be reported. Before doing so, try to produce a minimum working example of the code for the section where the error occurred. Add only those packages and files which are required by that section, and see if the error still appears. Using this approach shall solve most of the errors.\nInstall R-devel, which is the most recent version of R from svn / git or daily Windows build, and see if your bug still exists in R-devel (it may have been fixed very recently).\nSearch on the R-devel mailing list for messages with keywords related to your possible bug. If you find some related messages then read them to see if they clarify whether or not it is a bug. If you do not find any related messages, then please post a new message to R-devel.

One simple way to get the information from R is by running the maintainer(\"package_name\") command.\nThe bug report for R-Core supported packages, their documentations, and/ or a bug report for the R language itself can be submitted either to R-devel, see posting guide, or to Bugzilla. In the future, we hope to have an option to report an issue to the GitHub Mirror of the R svn server.\nIn order to report bugs, as well as fixes, using Bugzilla, please ensure that you have a Bugzilla account\nPlease ensure whether the bug is already fixed (in the upcoming changes in R) or reported (search for it from those already reported on Bugzilla, either on search existing bug reports, using the advanced search option here, or show open bugs new-to-old).\n\n\n\n4.5.2 Bug in the non R-Core supported packages and/or their documentations\nFor packages that are not maintained by the R-Core, the bug reports can be submitted at, perhaps, an issues tracker url on GitHub/GitLab/R-Forge. To find if such an issues tracker is available, you can look at the package DESCRIPTION file first (e.g. using packageDescription(\"package_name\")) to check if a url is provided in the BugReports field. If that is not available, then the package maintainer can be contacted (using maintainer(\"package_name\")). In R running the function bug.report(package = \"package_name\") shall direct you to either the GitHub issue tracker of the package, or to the bug tracking web page, or towards composing an e-mail to the package maintainer. This function bug.report is disabled in RStudio, by default. However, if you use utils::bug.report(package = \"package_name\") then it works on RStudio as well. Please ensure that the bug is not already reported or fixed before reporting it in any of the ways suggested above.\n\n\n4.5.3 Bug in a documentation website managed by the R Core Team\nThe R Core Team maintain a selection of websites that each have their own ways for reporting issues outside of Bugzilla. Have a read through the posting guide for R project mailing lists and then follow the instructions below to give feedback to the maintainers.\n\nR FAQ contains answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about R. Feedback on the R FAQ should be sent to the R-devel mailing list via R-devel@R-project.org.\nR for Windows FAQ contains answers specific to the Windows port of R. Feedback on the Windows FAQ should be sent to the R-SIG-windows mailing list (the Special Interest Group for Windows), via R-windows@R-project.org.\nR for macOS FAQ contains a user guide to the R.APP version of R and information on using R on macOS, supplementing the main R manuals. Feedback on the macOS FAQ should be sent to the R-SIG-Mac mailing list (the Special Interest Group for Mac ports of R), via r-sig-mac@r-project.org.\nFeedback on the R Project website should be sent to webmaster@r-project.org.\nFeedback on the website for The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) should be sent to cran-sysadmin@r-project.org.",

If you still feel that the resolution is incorrect, then raise a thoughtful question to the person who resolved it. If the issue was not carefully thought about in the first place then it is less likely to win any conversion of thought.\nAs a reminder, issues closed by a core developer on Bugzilla have already been carefully considered. Please do not reopen a closed issue. Although one can comment on a closed issue, if necessary. Every comment on an issue generates an email to every R-core member (unless they have the notifications disabled). So it would be best to be considerate while commenting on issues, especially in case of closed issues or when you are commenting in pure agreement without adding anything beyond that to a discussion (the +1 type posts which are perfectly acceptable in other contexts).",

    "text": "8.5 Making good patches\nWhen creating a patch for submission, there are several things that you can do to help ensure that your patch is accepted:\n\nMake sure to follow R’s coding standards (R is a GNU project and there are GNU coding standards). The coding style of the patch you submit should largely match with the codebase it is being applied to. If your patch has one or two minor discrepancies, then those may be fixed by the core developer who will eventually test your patch. However, if there are systematic deviations from the style guides your patch will be put on hold until you fix the formatting issues. There is no comprehensive official R style manual, however some nearly universal standards are summarised in this article.\nBe aware of backwards-compatibility considerations. While the core developer who eventually handles your patch will make the final call on whether something is acceptable, thinking about backwards-compatibility early will help prevent having your patch rejected on these grounds. Put yourself in the shoes of someone whose code will be broken by the change(s) introduced by the patch. It is quite likely that any change made will break someone’s code, so you need to have a good reason to make a change as you will be forcing someone to update their code. This obviously does not apply to new functions or new arguments. New arguments should be optional and have default values which maintain the existing behaviour. If in doubt, discuss the issue with experienced developers.\nMake sure you have proper tests to verify that your patch works as expected. Patches may not be accepted without the proper tests.\nMake sure the entire test suite runs without failure because of your changes. It is not sufficient to only run whichever test seems impacted by your changes, because there might be interactions unknown to you between your changes and some other part of the interpreter.\nProper documentation additions/changes should be included.\nEach bugfix should ideally be addressed by a single patch. In particular, do not fix more than one issue in the same patch (except, if one code change fixes all of them) and do not do cosmetic changes to unrelated code in the same patch as some bugfix.",

    "text": "8.7 Getting your patch reviewed\nTo begin with, please be patient. There are many more people submitting patches than there are people capable of reviewing your patches. Getting your patch reviewed requires a reviewer to have the spare time and motivation to look at your patch. We cannot force anyone to review patches and no one is employed to look at patches.\nThere is a #patches-for-review channel on the R Contributors slack where you can share your patch(es) for review/feedback before submitting to R-Core/Bugzilla. This can help with checking that you have included the important information and excluded redundant information.\nIf your patch has not received any notice from reviewers (i.e., no comment made) after one month, comment/message on the #patches-for-review channel to remind the members that the patch needs a review.\nWhen someone does manage to find the time to look at your patch they will most likely make comments about how it can be improved. It is then expected that you update your patch to address these comments, and the review process will thus iterate until a satisfactory solution has emerged.\n\n8.7.1 How to review a patch?\nOne of the bottlenecks in the R development process is the lack of code reviews. If you browse Bugzilla, you will see that numerous issues have a fix, but cannot be merged into the main source code repository, because no one has reviewed the proposed solution. Reviewing a patch can be just as informative as providing a patch and it will allow you to give constructive comments on another developer’s work. This guide provides a checklist for submitting a patch review. It is a common misconception that in order to be useful, a patch review has to be perfect. This is not the case at all. It is helpful to just test the patch and/or play around with the code and leave comments in the patch or on Bugzilla.\nIf a bug report or an issue has a patch attached that has not been reviewed, you can help by making sure that the patch:\n\nfollows the style guides;\nis a good solution to the problem it is trying to solve;\nincludes proper tests; and\nincludes proper documentation changes.\n\nAlso refer to Making good patches for more ideas. Doing all of this allows the core developer(s) and/ or maintainer(s) to more quickly look for subtle issues that only people with extensive experience working on R’s codebase will notice.",

This documentation was developed by the R Core Team with input from external contributors. The continuing involvement of the user community is important in maintaining this valuable documentation.\nThe involvement of the community takes many forms, from contributing content, to making bug reports or raising an issue when the documentation could be more complete or made easier to follow.\nThis chapter is about the ways people can contribute to R’s documentation, with guidance on how to do that. Any time you feel that you can clarify or fill gaps in existing documentation, your contribution is welcome and appreciated. If you find it difficult to deal with the markup formatting language used in the source files, you can ask for help with that part too. Please do not let the material in this chapter stand between the documentation and your desire to help out. However, not every good faith effort to change or extend the documentation will be accepted - sometimes the suggested changes may be incorrect; other times, while a change in wording may make some things clearer and easier to understand, the finer details of some corner case may become less clear, leading to the suggested changes being declined or modified by a member of R Core before applying them (if they agree the issue is important enough to fix).\nMaintaining the accuracy of R’s documentation and keeping a high level of quality takes a lot of effort. Community members, like you, help with writing, editing, and updating content, and these contributions are appreciated and welcomed.\nLooking at pre-existing documentation source files can be very helpful when getting started.\nYou can directly search for documentation issues/bugs on Bugzilla. Issues vary from typos to unclear documentation and items lacking documentation.\nIf you see a documentation issue that you would like to tackle, you can leave a comment on the issue saying you are going to try to solve the issue and mention roughly how long you think you will take to do so (this allows others to take on the issue if you happen to forget or lose interest).",

Extensive details of writing R documentation files can be found in the Writing R Extensions manual.\nThe language used in the documentations should follow these basic rules:\n\nAffirmative tone should be used to describe what the function does and how to use it effectively. Rather than creating worry in the mind of a reader, it should establish confident knowledge about the effective use of the particular function/feature.\nMore documentation is not necessarily better documentation. Long descriptions full of corner cases and caveats can create the impression that a function is more complex or harder to use than it actually is. Be succinct but exhaustive.\nShort code examples can help in understanding better. Readers can often grasp a simple example more quickly than they can digest a formal description. Usually people learn faster with concrete, motivating examples that match the context of a typical use case.\nGiving a code equivalent (or approximate equivalent) can be a useful addition to the description provided. You should carefully weigh whether the code equivalent adds value to the document.\nThe tone of the documentation needs to be respectful of the reader’s background. Lay out the relevant information, show motivating use cases, provide glossary links, and do your best to connect-the-dots. The documentation is meant for newcomers, many of whom will be using it to evaluate the R language as a whole. The experience needs to be positive and not leave the reader with worries that something bad will happen if they make a mistake.",

The .Rd file format can be further processed into a variety of formats, including LaTeX, HTML, and plain text. The .Rd files can be found in the man directory of the source code for the corresponding package.\nThere are three main parts of an .Rd file:\n\nHeader: This part is for the basic information of the document/file. For instance, the name of the file, the topics documented, a title, a short textual description, and R usage information for the objects documented.\nBody: This part includes further information on the function’s arguments and return value.\nFooter: This part is optional. Usually the keyword information is included here.\n\nAll the above information is included in a .Rd file within a series of sections with standard names (user-defined sections are also allowed). These sections are discussed below:\n\n\\title section:\n\nCapitalize each word.\nDo not end in a period.\nAvoid use of markup language (because markup language need not be suitable for various hypertext search systems).\n\n\\usage and \\examples sections:\n\nLine length of 65 characters is advised.\nUse TRUE instead of T and FALSE instead of F.\nAdd spaces around binary operators.\nAdd spaces after commas in the argument lists.\nUse &lt;- rather than = for assignments.\nAdd spaces around the &lt;- operator.\nDo not use tabs to indent (as these do not render correctly on all possible pagers).\nUse 4 spaces to indent the (example) code.\nMake sure the examples are directly executable.\nThe examples should be system-independent.\nThe examples should not require special facilities (for instance, Internet access or write permission to specific directories).\nExamples should also not take longer than necessary to run, as they are run when checking a build of R.\n\n\\source and \\references sections:\n\nAuthor(s) names should be written in the form Author, A.

    "text": "10.1 How translations work\nThis chapter covers internationalization in R, i.e., the display of messages in languages other than English. All output in R (such as messages emitted by stop(), warning(), or message()) is eligible for translation, as are menu labels in the GUI. Depending on the version of R that you are using, some of the languages might already be available while others may need work. R leverages the gettext program to handle the conversion from English to arbitrary target languages.\nHaving messages available in other languages can be an important bridge for R learners not confident in English – rather than learning two things at once (coding in R and processing diagnostic information in English), they can focus on coding while getting more natural errors/warnings in their native tongue.\nThe gettext manual is a more canonical reference for a deep understanding of how gettext works. This chapter will just give a broad overview, with particular focus on how things work for R, with the goal of making it as low-friction as possible for developers and users to contribute new/updated translations.\nEach of the default packages distributed with R (i.e., those found in ./src/library such as base, utils, and stats and which have priority base) contains a po directory. A po directory is the central location for ataloguing/translating each package’s messages. It contains a template message file (.pot) for the corresponding ackage along with translated .po files (that are created using the template .pot file).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1.1 .pot files\nA .pot file is a template file found inside the po directory of an R package. This template file is a snapshot of the messages available in a given domain. A domain in R typically identifies a source package and a source language (either R or C/C++). For example, the file R-stats.pot (found in the R sources in ./src/library/stats/po) is a catalogue of all messages produced by R code in the stats package, while stats.pot is a catalogue of all messages produced by C code in the stats package.\nThe ‘base’ package has two exceptions to the basic pattern described above. The first is the domain for messages produced by the C code which is the fundamental backing of R itself (especially, but not exclusively, the C code under ./src/main[^The file ./po/POTFILES is the canonical source of files searched. Note that while, technically, it is possible to support translations in Fortran code, R does not currently do so. Only a handful of messages are produced by Fortran routines in the R sources.]). The associated .pot file is R.pot and is found in ./src/library/base/po. R-base.potis a normal.potfile because base has a normalR` directory.\nThe second is the domain for the Windows R GUI, i.e., the text in the menus and elsewhere in the R GUI program available for running R on Windows. These messages are stored in the RGui.pot domain, also in the po directory for base, and are most commonly derived from C code found in ./src/gnuwin32. One reason to keep this domain separate is that it is only relevant to one platform (Windows). In particular, Windows has historically different character encodings, so that it made more sense for Windows developers to produce translations specifically or Windows, since it is non-trivial for non-Windows users to test their translations for the Windows GUI.\n\n10.1.1.1 Generating .pot files\nFor outside contributors, there’s no need to update .pot files – translators will typically take the R .pot files as given and generate .po files. These will be sent along to a language-specific translation maintainer, who then compiles them to send to the R Core developer responsible for translations, who finally applies them as a patch.\nTo emphasize, this section is almost always not needed for contributing translations – it is here for completeness and edification.\n\n\n\n10.1.2 .po files\n.po files are the most important artifacts for translators. They provide the (human-readable!) mapping between the messages as they appear in the source code and how the messages will appear to users in translated locales.\n\n10.1.2.1 Singular messages\nMost messages appear as msgid/msgstr pairs. The former gives the message as it appears in the code, while the latter shows how it should appear in translation. For example, here is an error in German (locale: de) informing the user that their input must be of class POSIXt\nmsgid \"'to' must be a \\\"POSIXt\\\" object\"\nmsgstr \"'to' muss ein \\\"POSIXt\\\" Objekt sein\"\nSee this in context in the R-de.po source file.\nThe same message can also be found in R-it.po giving the translation to Italian:\nmsgid \"'to' must be a \\\"POSIXt\\\" object\"\nmsgstr \"'to' dev'essere un oggetto \\\"POSIXt\\\"\"\n\n\n10.1.2.2 Plural messages\nSome messages will have different translations depending on some input determined at run time (e.g., the length() of an input object or the nrow() of a data.frame). This presents a challenge for translation, because different languages have different rules for how to pluralize different ordinal numbers[^See the relevant section of the gettext manual]. For example, English typically adds s to any quantity of items besides 1 (1 dog, 2 dogs, 100 dogs, even 0 dogs). Chinese typically does not alter the word itself in similar situations (一只狗, 两只狗, 一百只狗, 零只狗); Arabic has six different ways to pluralize a quantity.\nIn .po files, this shows up in the form of msgid_plural entries, followed by several ordered msgstr entries. Here’s an example from R-de.po1:\nmsgid \"Warning message:\\n\"\nmsgid_plural \"Warning messages:\\n\"\nmsgstr[0] \"Warnmeldung:\\n\"\nmsgstr[1] \"Warnmeldungen:\\n\"\nThe two entries in English correspond to the singular and plural messages; the two entries in German correspond similarly, because pluralization rules in German are similar to those in English. The situation in Lithuanian (R-lt.po) is more divergent:\nmsgid \"Warning message:\\n\"\nmsgid_plural \"Warning messages:\\n\"\nmsgstr[0] \"Įspėjantis pranešimas:\\n\"\nmsgstr[1] \"Įspėjantys pranešimai:\\n\"\nmsgstr[2] \"Įspėjančių pranešimų:\\n\"\nThis corresponds to the 3 different ways to pluralize words in Polish.\nWhat do 0, 1, and 2 correspond to, exactly? Ideally, this will be clear to native speakers of the language, but for clarity, it is the solution to a small arithmetic problem that can be found in the language’s metadata entry. Look for the Plural-Forms entry in the metadata at the top of the .po file; here it is for Lithuanian:\n\"Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=(n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10&gt;=2 && (n\"\n\"%100&lt;10 || n%100&gt;=20) ? 1 : 2);\\n\"\nnplurals tells us how many entries correspond to each msgid_plural for this language. plural tells us, for the quantity n, which entry to use. The arithmetic is C code; most important if you really want to parse this and are only familiar with R code is C’s ternary operator: test ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse is a handy way to write R’s if (test) valueIfTrue else valueIfFalse.\nParsing, we get the following associations:\n\nthe 0 entry corresponds to when a number equals 1 modulo 10 (i.e., 1, 11, 21, 31, …) except numbers equaling 11 modulo 100 (i.e., 11, 111, 211, 311, …). Combining, that’s 1, 21, 31, …, 91, 101, 121, 131, …, 191, …\nthe 1 entry corresponds to numbers at least 2 modulo 10 (2, 3, …, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, …) and either below 10 modulo 100 (0, 1, …, 9, 100, 101, …, 109, …) or exceeding 20 modulo 100 (21, 22, …, 99). Combining, that’s 2, 3, …, 9, 22, 23, …, 29, 32, 33, … 39, …, 102, 103, …, 109, 122, 123, …\nThe 2 entry corresponds to all other numbers, i.e. 0, 10, 11, 12, …, 19, 20, 30, …, 90, 100, 110, 111, 112, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.3 .mo files\n.po files are plain text, but while helpful for human readers, this is inefficient for consumption by computers. The .mo format is a “compiled” version of the .po file optimized for retrieving messages when R is running.\nIn R-devel, the conversion from .po to .mo is done by R Core – you don’t need to compile these files yourself. They are stored in the R sources at ./src/library/translations/inst in various language-specific subdirectories.",

See the blog post on how R can use your help: Translating R messages.\nTo get started contributing to translations, please follow the steps below:\nStep 1: Register an Account at Weblate\nWeblate is an open-source platform for collaborative translation of software projects. Register an account on R’s Weblate server, https://translate.rx.studio/, to start contributing.\n\nNote: To get started follow the detailed workflow and convention for translation which is given here: https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/\n\nStep 2: Choose a Component and Language\nSelect a component of R with less than 100% translation. Each component corresponds to the messages in either the R code or the C code of one of the packages in base R, e.g. base (R files), or tools (C files). There is one special case: base (R GUI), which corresponds to the messages in the Windows Graphical User Interface.\nAfter selecting a component, you can select your preferred language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Translate the Message\nNow, you can click on Translate button on your right.\n\nNote: More information for String status visit: https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/workflows.html#translation-states\n\n\nThen, start translating the message by typing the translation in the text box.\n\n\nIf you are confident that the translation is correct, make sure the “Needs editing” box is unchecked.\nIf you are unsure about how to translate, write the translation as a Suggest button instead.\nFinally, Click “Save and Continue” to save the translation and continue.\n\n\n\nNote: Use Glossary feature within Weblate making translation easy and consistent: https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/glossary/\n\n\nNote: Make sure to use Automatic Suggestions as a starting point.\n\n\nClick on Automatic Suggestions (machine translation)\nAccept it if you think the automatic suggestion looks good\n\n\n\nSome Tips to follow:\n\nBe consistent: Use the same words and phrases throughout the translation to make it consistent and avoid confusion.\nCheck for technical issues: After finishing the translation, check if you have any alerts or warning in the Weblate string status, e.g. double instead of single space.\nFollow language specific guidelines: Check how other languages have translated the string. Even if you are not fluent in another language it can give you an idea of how other translators have handled it, especially which parts are left verbatim. A detailed guide is given here : Conventions-for-translations#languages-and-contributions\n\nRelated links: https://contributor.r-project.org/tutorials/translating-r-to-your-language/",

This site is automatically built from the original manuals site using a number of scripts in the r-manuals GitHub repo.",
