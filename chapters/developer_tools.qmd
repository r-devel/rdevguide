# Developer Tools {#DevTools}

This chapter lists resources and tools which R developers may use. Here we will go over some commonly used tools that are relevant to Râ€™s workflow. As there are several ways to accomplish these tasks, this chapter reflects methods suitable for new contributors. Experienced contributors may desire a different approach.

## Subversion (svn) client

Subversion (svn) is a version control system that tracks any changes made to files and directories. You can install either the [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/) (command line tool, and Windows Explorer integration) or the [SlikSVN](https://sliksvn.com/download/) (just the command line tool) client. They have Windows installers and can be used from Windows cmd or RStudio terminal.

Some resources for learning subversion commands:

1. [Apache Subversion quick start guide](http://subversion.apache.org/quick-start)

2. [TortoiseSVN commands](https://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-cli-main.html) 

3. [SlikSVN basics](https://sliksvn.com/support/subversion-basics-using-check-out-update-check-in-commit/)

4. [Subversion book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)

## Globally search for a regular expression and print matching lines (grep)

[grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a command line utility for searching plain text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Refer the [grep manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html) for more commands.

## Git

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is also a version control system for tracking changes in any files and directories. View [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) for learning git commands.

## GitHub

1. [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

2. [Opening an issue from code](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-code)
