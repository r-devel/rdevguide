# Message Translations

This chapter covers internationalization in R, i.e., the display of
messages in languages other than English. All output in R (such as
messages emitted by `stop()`, `warning()`, or `message()`) is eligible
for translation, as are menu labels in the GUI. Depending on the version
of R that you are using, some of the languages might already be
available while others may need work. R leverages the
[`gettext`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) program to handle the
conversion from English to arbitrary target languages.

Having messages available in other languages can be an important bridge
for R learners not confident in English -- rather than learning two
things at once (coding in R and processing diagnostic information in
English), they can focus on coding while getting more natural
errors/warnings in their native tongue.

The [`gettext`
manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/index.html) is a
more canonical reference for a deep understanding of how `gettext`
works. This chapter will just give a broad overview, with particular
focus on how things work for R, with the goal of making it as
low-friction as possible for developers and users to contribute
new/updated translations.

## How translations work

Each of the default packages distributed with R (i.e., those found in
`./src/library` such as `base`, `utils`, and `stats` and which have
priority base) contains a `po` directory. A `po` directory is the
central location for ataloguing/translating each package's messages. It
contains a template message file (`.pot`) for the corresponding ackage
along with translated `.po` files (that are created using the template
`.pot` file).

### `.pot` files

A `.pot` file is a template file found inside the `po` directory of an R
package. This template file is a snapshot of the messages available in a
given **domain**. A domain in R typically identifies a source package
and a source language (either R or C/C++). For example, the file
`R-stats.pot` (found in the R sources in `./src/library/stats/po`) is a
catalogue of all messages produced by R code in the `stats` package,
while `stats.pot` is a catalogue of all messages produced by C code in
the `stats` package.

The 'base' package has two exceptions to the basic pattern described
above. The first is the domain for messages produced by the C code which
is the fundamental backing of R itself (especially, but not exclusively,
the C code under ./src/main[\^The file `./po/POTFILES` is the canonical
source of files searched. Note that while, technically, it is possible
to support translations in Fortran code, R does not currently do so.
Only a handful of messages are produced by Fortran routines in the R
sources.]). The associated `.pot` file is `R.pot` and is found in
`./src/library/base/po`.
R-base.pot`is a normal`.pot`file because base has a normal`R\`
directory.

The second is the domain for the Windows R GUI, i.e., the text in the
menus and elsewhere in the R GUI program available for running R on
Windows. These messages are stored in the `RGui.pot` domain, also in the
`po` directory for `base`, and are most commonly derived from C code
found in `./src/gnuwin32`. One reason to keep this domain separate is
that it is only relevant to one platform (Windows). In particular,
Windows has historically different character encodings, so that it made
more sense for Windows developers to produce translations specifically
or Windows, since it is non-trivial for non-Windows users to test their
translations for the Windows GUI.

#### Generating `.pot` files

For outside contributors, there's no need to update .pot files --
translators will typically take the R `.pot` files as given and generate
`.po` files. These will be sent along to a language-specific translation
maintainer, who then compiles them to send to the R Core developer
responsible for translations, who finally applies them as a patch.

To emphasize, this section is almost always not needed for contributing
translations -- it is here for completeness and edification.

### `.po` files

.po files are the most important artifacts for translators. They provide
the (human-readable!) mapping between the messages as they appear in the
source code and how the messages will appear to users in translated
locales.

#### Singular messages

Most messages appear as `msgid`/`msgstr` pairs. The former gives the
message as it appears in the code, while the latter shows how it should
appear in translation. For example, here is an error in German (locale:
`de`) informing the user that their input must be of class `POSIXt`

```         
msgid "'to' must be a \"POSIXt\" object"
msgstr "'to' muss ein \"POSIXt\" Objekt sein"
```

See this in context in the [`R-de.po` source
file](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/po/R-de.po).

The same message can also be found in
[`R-it.po`](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/po/R-it.po)
giving the translation to Italian:

```         
msgid "'to' must be a \"POSIXt\" object"
msgstr "'to' dev'essere un oggetto \"POSIXt\""
```

#### Plural messages

Some messages will have different translations depending on some input
determined at run time (e.g., the `length()` of an input object or the
`nrow()` of a `data.frame`). This presents a challenge for translation,
because different languages have different rules for how to pluralize
different ordinal numbers[\^See the [relevant
section](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Plural-forms.html)
of the `gettext` manual]. For example, English typically adds `s` to any
quantity of items besides 1 (1 dog, 2 dog`s`, 100 dog`s`, even 0
dog`s`). Chinese typically does not alter the word itself in similar
situations (一只狗, 两只狗, 一百只狗, 零只狗); Arabic has *six*
different ways to pluralize a quantity.

In `.po` files, this shows up in the form of `msgid_plural` entries,
followed by several ordered `msgstr` entries. Here's an example from
[`R-de.po`](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/c715d61cb74b3fee2d035faed9b258e86e420b75/src/library/base/po/R-de.po#L2015-L2018)[^09-message-translations-1]:

[^09-message-translations-1]: The GitHub mirror of the [actual svn
    repo](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/) is linked in this chapter
    as it is a better interface for browsing the source files.

```         
msgid "Warning message:\n"
msgid_plural "Warning messages:\n"
msgstr[0] "Warnmeldung:\n"
msgstr[1] "Warnmeldungen:\n"
```

The two entries in English correspond to the singular and plural
messages; the two entries in German correspond similarly, because
pluralization rules in German are similar to those in English. The
situation in Lithuanian
([`R-lt.po`](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/c715d61cb74b3fee2d035faed9b258e86e420b75/src/library/base/po/R-lt.po#L1999-L2003))
is more divergent:

```         
msgid "Warning message:\n"
msgid_plural "Warning messages:\n"
msgstr[0] "Įspėjantis pranešimas:\n"
msgstr[1] "Įspėjantys pranešimai:\n"
msgstr[2] "Įspėjančių pranešimų:\n"
```

This corresponds to the 3 different ways to pluralize words in Polish.

What do `0`, `1`, and `2` correspond to, exactly? Ideally, this will be
clear to native speakers of the language, but for clarity, it is the
solution to a small arithmetic problem that can be found in the
language's metadata entry. Look for the `Plural-Forms` entry in the
metadata at the top of the `.po` file; [here it is for
Lithuanian](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/c715d61cb74b3fee2d035faed9b258e86e420b75/src/library/base/po/R-lt.po#L18-L19):

```         
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=(n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && (n"
"%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2);\n"
```

`nplurals` tells us how many entries correspond to each `msgid_plural`
for this language. `plural` tells us, for the quantity `n`, which entry
to use. The arithmetic is C code; most important if you really want to
parse this and are only familiar with R code is C's [ternary
operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:):
`test ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse` is a handy way to write R's
`if (test) valueIfTrue else valueIfFalse`.

Parsing, we get the following associations:

-   the `0` entry corresponds to when a number equals 1 modulo 10 (i.e.,
    1, 11, 21, 31, ...) *except* numbers equaling 11 modulo 100 (i.e.,
    11, 111, 211, 311, ...). Combining, that's 1, 21, 31, ..., 91, 101,
    121, 131, ..., 191, ...
-   the `1` entry corresponds to numbers at least 2 modulo 10 (2, 3,
    ..., 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, ...) and *either* below 10 modulo 100 (0, 1,
    ..., 9, 100, 101, ..., 109, ...) *or* exceeding 20 modulo 100 (21,
    22, ..., 99). Combining, that's 2, 3, ..., 9, 22, 23, ..., 29, 32,
    33, ... 39, ..., 102, 103, ..., 109, 122, 123, ...
-   The `2` entry corresponds to all other numbers, i.e. 0, 10, 11, 12,
    ..., 19, 20, 30, ..., 90, 100, 110, 111, 112, ...

### `.mo` files

`.po` files are plain text, but while helpful for human readers, this is
inefficient for consumption by computers. The .mo format is a "compiled"
version of the .po file optimized for retrieving messages when R is
running.

In R-devel, the conversion from .po to .mo is done by R Core -- you
don't need to compile these files yourself. They are stored in the R
sources at `./src/library/translations/inst` in various
language-specific subdirectories.

## How to contribute new translations

<!-- TODO(michaelchirico): Creating and editing .po files, testing the translations worked, **encoding**, translation teams, release schedule -->

Translating R into different languages helps make it more user-friendly
for non-English speakers and helps to grow the R community. See the blog
post on how [R can use your help: Translating R
messages](https://blog.r-project.org/2022/07/25/r-can-use-your-help-translating-r-messages).

To get started contributing to translations, please follow the steps
below:

**Step 1: Register an Account at Weblate**

Weblate is an open-source platform for collaborative translation of
software projects. Register an account on R's Weblate server,
<https://translate.rx.studio/>, to start contributing.

> *Note: To get started follow the detailed workflow and convention for
> translation which is given here:
> <https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/>*

**Step 2: Choose a Component and Language**

Select a component of R with less than 100% translation. Each component
corresponds to the messages in either the R code or the C code of one of
the packages in base R, e.g. base (R files), or tools (C files). There
is one special case: base (R GUI), which corresponds to the messages in
the Windows Graphical User Interface.

After selecting a component, you can select your preferred language.

<!-- **Step 3: Check String Status** -->

<!-- Click on "Unfinished strings" to see the strings of messages that need -->

<!-- translation. All translated strings appears as Strings waiting for -->

<!-- review. For more information, please visit our Weblate FAQs information -->

<!-- given here: https://github.com/r-devel/translations/wiki/Weblate-FAQ -->

<!-- ![](../img/unfinished_strings_translate.png) -->

**Step 3: Translate the Message**

Now, you can click on Translate button on your right.

> Note: More information for String status visit:
> <https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/workflows.html#translation-states>

![](../img/translate_button.png)

Then, start translating the message by typing the translation in the
text box.

![](../img/translate_string_and_save.png)

-   If you are **confident** that the **translation is correct**, make
    sure the "Needs editing" box is **unchecked**.

-   If you are **unsure** about how to translate, write the translation
    as a **Suggest** button instead.

-   Finally, Click **"Save and Continue"** to save the translation and
    continue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Note:** Use Glossary feature within Weblate making translation easy
> and consistent:
> <https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/glossary/>

> **Note:** Make sure to use Automatic Suggestions as a starting point.

1.  Click on Automatic Suggestions (machine translation)

2.  Accept it if you think the automatic suggestion looks good

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some Tips to follow:**

-   **Be consistent:** Use the same words and phrases throughout the
    translation to make it consistent and avoid confusion.

-   **Check for technical issues:** After finishing the translation,
    check if you have any alerts or warning in the Weblate string
    status, e.g. double instead of single space.

-   **Follow language specific guidelines:** Check how other languages
    have translated the string. Even if you are not fluent in another
    language it can give you an idea of how other translators have
    handled it, especially which parts are left verbatim. A detailed
    guide is given here :

## Bulk Translations

Instead of translating one string at a time, it is possible to bulk translate a whole component of R at once:

1. Navigate to the translations for a particular component in a particular language, e.g. https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/base-c/ar/

2. Select **'Tools > Automatic translation'**

![Tools drop-down menu with "Automatic Translations" selected](../img/translate_automatic_translation.png)


3. In the dialog,
 - under **'Automatic translation mode'**, select **'Add as "needing edit"'**[^09-message-translations-2]:
 

[^09-message-translations-2]: By selecting **'Add as "needing edit"'**, the autotranslated strings would be treated as "fuzzy" translations, i.e. they would be added to the component source files when a patch is made, but they would NOT be used. 
 
 - under **'Search filter'**, select **'Untranslated strings'**
 - under **'Source of automated translations'**, select **'Machine translation'**
 - under **'Machine translation engines'**, select **'Microsoft Translator'**[^09-message-translations-3]:

  
[^09-message-translations-3]: Microsoft Translator is preferred for bulk translation as our free tier covers 2 million characters/month, where DeepL only allows 500k chars/month. If Microsoft Translator translations are much worse than DeepL, it may be useful to use it to translate one string at a time.

![Automatic Translations dialog box](../img/translate_dialog.png)

4.  Review the translations, edit as necessary and uncheck **"needing edit"**.
