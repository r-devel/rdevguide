View the [affiliations of R Core members](). We've left it up to the individual core developers to list areas of expertise (or things they are willing to maintain) if they wish.
<!-- TODO add URL to bios, perhaps on the R project website -->

The [Contributors page on the R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html) also lists contributors, outside the R Core team, who provided invaluable help by donating code, bug fixes, and documentation.
