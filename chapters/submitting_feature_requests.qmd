# Submitting Feature Requests {#FeatureRequests}

## What is a feature request?

A feature request is a suggestion or proposal to add new functionality or improve an existing feature.

We recommend sharing your feature request idea on the [R-devel](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel) mailing list and gaining support from R-Core members and other users to increase its likelihood of acceptance.

## How to submit a feature request?

You can submit a feature request by [filing a bug](https://bugs.r-project.org/enter_bug.cgi) on Bugzilla. Under Component, select "Wishlist", the designated label for feature requests.

Similar to bugs, you should ensure that the feature request is [not already reported](#already-reported-bugs) and [follow best practices](#good-practices-bugs) whenever possible.

## Examples of feature requests submitted on Bugzilla

If you like to see how feature requests are reported on Bugzilla, here are some examples:

1. [Bug 18690 - Increase CONSOLE_BUFFER_SIZE and / or warn if input is truncated](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18690): A feature request to ease the readability of long lines.
2. [Bug 17912 - ordering elements in sessionInfo() by alphabetical order](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17912): A feature request that was not accepted due to the prioritization of load time in session information.
