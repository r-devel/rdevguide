# R Coding Style {#R-coding-style}

This chapter introduces contributors to the coding style typically used by R Core, so that R Core can focus on the code and not style issues when reviewing patches. 

## General recommendations

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in R and C code.
- Use spaces after commas and either side of operators.
- Use `<-` rather than `=` for assignment.
- Use `"`, instead of `'`, for quoting text.
- Use `TRUE` and `FALSE`, not `T` and `F`.
- Keep lines no longer than 80 characters.
- Avoid using special characters in file names (numbers, letters, `-`, and `_` are acceptable).
- Put a space after (not before) a comma.
- Put a space before and after `()` when used with `if`, `for`, or `while`.
- Place a space after `()` used for function arguments.
- Put a space before `|>` (the base R pipe operator).

In general, try to make sure the code you write in an existing file has a style consistent with that file.
